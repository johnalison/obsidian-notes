Three Variances:
- 402.04.04.02 CE - Module Factories
- 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2
- 402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB


# 402.04.04.02 CE - Module Factories

\

There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$355k in the cost account 402.04.04.02 CE - Module Factories.  This variance is for delivery of the chiller, thermal testing units, and test stand electronics for the 3 assembly centers and labor associated with their setup and commissioning. The delays are caused by international partners not keep their schedule. 

This is a result of delays in the chiller design and delivery testing electronics. The current estimate is that the testing electronics will be shipped in a few weeks to CMU, TTU and UCSB in time for the MAC ramp-up.  The chiller will likely be available in a few months. 


# 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2

$224k
- $208k : Assemble and test module 1-240 and 
- 14k associated Cleanroom consumables

There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$224k in the cost account 
402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly at CMU.  The variance is from the assembly and testing of the first 240 modules and the associated cleanroom consumables.


This variance is expected due to missing input parts: hexaboards and baseplates. 
It is expected that CMU will start the assembly of modules once parts will become available.

# Impact
The activities contributing to the cumulative SV is due to upstream delay of input parts and will be completed later than scheduled.  When the input parts become available the value will be earned and it should not impact the overall schedule.


# 402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB

$431k
- $369k
- 30 Support operation of all module sites


There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$431k in the cost account 
402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB.  The variance has two pieces:
1) -400k Assembly, testing and shipping of full-size equivalent odd-sized modules 1-16%
2) - 30k for supporting production at other assembly site

This variance is expected due to missing input parts: hexaboards and baseplates. 

It is expected that UCSB will start the assembly of modules once parts will become available.


# Impact
The activities contributing to the cumulative SV are due to upstream delays of the input parts and will be completed later than scheduled.  When the input parts become available the value will be earned and it should not impact the overall schedule.
