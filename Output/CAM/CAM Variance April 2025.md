# 402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB

There is a cumulative cost variance of -$246k in the cost account 402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB. This is expected and is consistent with the cumulative schedule variance discussed below. Delays in schedule, due to missing input parts, into cost variance from the cost of labor not earning value. 


There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$457k in the cost account 
402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB.  The variance has two pieces:
1) 85% is due to assembly, testing and shipping of full-size equivalent odd-sized modules 1-16%
2) the remained is for supporting production at other assembly site

This variance is expected due to missing input parts: hexaboards and baseplates. 

UCSB has begun assembly of modules ! 
They have built 15 HD Full modules with Titanium baseplates and HGCROCV3b-4 

The ordering of the final assembly tooling is complete; the second batch of tools have been checked out and delivered to CMU and TTU.  UCSB has been continuing tests on the irradiated modules with Ti baseplate

# 402.04.04.02 CE - Module Factories	

There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$340k in the cost account 
402.04.04.02 CE - Module Factories  The variance has three pieces:
- - 220k for delivery of production test stands and associated infrastructure 
- -100k for support and delivery of final module tooling
- -20k for purchase of shipping cases

This is a result of delays in the thermal chamber design and delivery of testing electronics. The current estimate is that the testing electronics will be shipped in a few weeks to CMU, TTU and UCSB in time for the MAC ramp-up. The thermal chambers are now available and will begin shipping (2/week) over the next few weeks. A decision on the shipping crates has been made an purchases have started.  The procurement of the final tooling is well under way and much of this value should be earned this month.  The test infrastructure will also be ordered next week, the statement of work is in hand at CMU. 

# Impact:
The activities contributing to this variance is due to upstream delay of input components needed for the final module teststands and will be completed later than scheduled. When the components become available the value will be earned and it should not impact the overall schedule.


# 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2

207

There is a schedule variance of -$207 in the cost account 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2 (CMU).  The variance is from the assembly and testing of the first 240 modules and the associated cleanroom consumables.

This variance is expected due to missing input parts: hexaboards and baseplates. We received 15 hexaboards (v3c) in March and produce our first 15 v3c hexaboards!  This was done at a rate of 2/day, we will move to 4/day later this month then the final tooling is ready. We have received the  final tooling and are in the process of commissioning it. This will be done using Hexaboards v3b + CuT baseplates that we have on hand. We expect 40 additional Ti baseplates and v3c hexaboards later this month.
