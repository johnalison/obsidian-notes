USCB has finished the pre-series. 5 LD right on Ti have been assembled at UCSB. A plan has been developed for ESD protection/mitigation during tape application and backing paper removal. The idea is to short both sides of the HV capacitor together and connect them to ground through a flexible, wide conductor incorporated directly into the transfer tape fixture.  
  
CMU has added automation for reading QR codes and sensor scratch pads. They have added dry air cabinets capacity for storage of silicon and assembled modules.Â  CMU has recently assembled a carbon fiber module with the latest gluing pattern. This module showed improved electrical performance as suggested by previous studies from UCSB.  
  
Plans have been made to have the components available for pre-production. The silicon is already in hand; the hexaboards and baseplates will be delivered to the MACs in early November.  
  
Orders for the gantry tooling have started to be placed through Fermilab. The orders will proceed in batches and the tooling will become available in early 2025.  
  
Improved automated encapsulation programs have been documented and provided to the other MACs.  
  
A first version of the local database infrastructure for pre-production is in place. It is ready, once we have settled on a standard part naming scheme.
