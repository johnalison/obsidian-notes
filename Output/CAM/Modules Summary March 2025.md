CMU has produced a total of 22 CuW (v3b) modules. 18 of these have been shipped to CERN for cassette testing. We are currently scaling up productivity and capacity. The Gantry software is being upgraded to assembly 4 modules per run and we have purchased a shipping crate to be used during production. If it is satisfactory, will buy another.  We received 600 sensors and 15 ROC v3c hexaboards.  The hexaboards were tested with the new Kria teststands and all look good.  We will build 15 more v3c - Ti module after the final tooling is commissioned. 


UCSB has inspected and shipped the more of the final gantry tooling to CMU and TTU.  They have now placed all of the final gantry tooling orders through Fermilab. They have received parts from CERN: 37 hexaborads (v3b) / 5 trophy boards. They have commissioned the new Kria teststands and have tested HD hexaboards. They will resume module assembly of HD Full next and build a few "no tape" modules to validate FEA studies.
