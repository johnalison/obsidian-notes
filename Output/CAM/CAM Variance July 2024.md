# SV
There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$296k in the cost account 402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB.  The variance has two pieces
1) - $120k variance from Assembly of odd-sized preseries modules
2) - $165k variance from Assembly, supervision, and test the first 8% of full-size equivalent odd-sized modules

For the preseries, although $1,293k of work has been earned, the schedule is behind the $1,414 expected. This is due to missing input parts: hexaboards and baseplates. 

Similarly, the production of the first 8% of partial modules is delayed because of missing input parts. 

It is expected that UCSB will start the assembly of odd-size modules once parts will become available.

# CV
There is a cumulative CV of ~$242k in the cost account 402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB.  The underlying cause of the cost variance is the SV described above. There are costs associated to the engineers, but less than expected earned value because the schedule delay: "standing army problem".  

Although no value was earned on schedule activities, important progress has been made. 
UCSB has assembled a number of HD full modules, are working to improving ESD safety, are  finalizing tooling, doing further baseplate R&D, and are studying the results of a recent Irradiation campaign on the hybrid-gluing. 


# Impact

The activities contributing to the cumulative SV and CV are due to upstream delay of input parts and will be completed later than scheduled.  When input parts come available the value will be earned and it should not impact the overall schedule.

An old var from Manfred:

---------------

Cumulative:

Schedule Variance:

There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$478k which is similar to last month. The SV appears mainly in the following cost accounts:

(a) 402.44.101791 CE-UCSB Module Assembly OPC UNIV Labor with a SV of -218k that consists of -187k to assemble odd-size modules and -31k for labor to develop fixturing for odd-size module assembly 

(b) 402.44.201791 CE-UCSB Module Assembly MIE UNIV Labor with a SV of -231k consisting of SM50140 (Assemble odd-sized preseries modules) 

The main issue for the SV is the same as in previous months although the SV has begun to decrease with UCSB starting work on some of the scheduled tasks, e.g. SM61270. Historically UCSB had not yet been able to start working on the scheduled task of assembly of odd-sized modules but kept working on other tasks such as helping the other MACs prepare for qualification or assemble some live standard modules for testing at CERN. This work required more effort and resulted in delaying the scheduled tasks. It is expected that UCSB will start the assembly of odd-size modules in the next few months once parts will become available. The delay of CERN providing odd-size hexaboards to US-CMS is now the main reason for this delay and thus the SV.

Cost Variance:

There is a cumulative cost variance of -532k [1225k earned with 1703k budgeted but 1757k actuals (over-)spent]. This CV appears mainly in the following cost accounts.

(a) 402.44.101791 CE-UCSB Module Assembly OPC UNIV Labor with a CV of -$111k: $382k of actual costs/accruals have been charged to this account while $271k has been earned on a budget of 489k resulting in a CV of -$111k. 

(b) 402.44.201791 CE-UCSB Module Assembly MIE UNIV Labor with a CV of -$246k: $1069k of actual costs/accruals have been charged to this account while $822k has been earned on a budget of $1053k resulting in a CV of -$247k.

(c) 402.44.201792 CE-UCSB Module Assembly MIE UNIV M&S  with a CV of -$143k: $159k of actual costs/accruals have been charged to this account while only $16k has been earned so far on a budget of $8k resulting in a CV of -$143k. 

As pointed out for the SV above, this is the same issue as in previous months. UCSB has not yet been able to start working on some of the scheduled tasks such as assembly of odd-sized modules but kept working on other tasks such as assembling some real modules for testing at CERN as well as helping the other MACs prepare for qualification. This previous work required more effort and resulted in not earning value for scheduled work resulting in the cost overrun. However, some of the work has now been started and is being statused monthly slowly reducing the CV. 

---------------
Impact:

The activities contributing to the cumulative SV and CV are all activities that have been delayed and will be completed later than scheduled but will not impact the overall schedule such as the start of module production.
