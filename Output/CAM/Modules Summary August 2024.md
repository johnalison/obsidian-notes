For modules it has generally been a slow month. Lots of people were away and there were no general MAC Meetings. 

UCSB has been planning site visits to TTU and CMU. These are now scheduled for end of October and will involve two full days at each MAC.
 
CMU has finished the finished pre-series modules. This month we built 6 additional modules (carbon fiber baseplates with hybrid gluing) all done using the two-at-a-time gantry assembly protocol. No dead half chips were observed.  We are currently studying the electrical performance of the modules. 

We have developed a GUI to interface the wirebonding QA/QC information to the DB. It has been prototyped at CMU and now being integrated at UCSB, we will then proceed to roll it out to other MACs. 

There has been progress on defining QA/QC databases tables. And we are testing local to global DB uploads.

CMU has also lost an electronics Eva engineer, who is moving back to Seattle.
