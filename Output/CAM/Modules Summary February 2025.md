CMU has on-boarded two new technicians in February; they are quickly coming up to speed.  Assembly of the pre-production (ROC-3b) modules has continued at the target rate of 2/day.  This process has been useful in finding kinks in the production workflow and in onboarding the new comers. So far, 20 modules have been produced and we can regularly hit 2 modules/day. This rate will be increased once the final gantry tooling is received and commissioned.  We are on track to finish ROC-3b mini-rampup in early March. Writing to the central database has also been exercised.  


UCSB has inspected and shipped the final gantry tool to CMU and TTU.  They have now placed all of the final gantry tooling orders through Fermilab, with expected delivery in a few weeks. UCSB had made further studies of the irradiated modules with Ti baseplates. These modules have been thermal cycled up to 100 times, with no loss of channels or delamination observed.  USCB is ready for mini-Ramp when parts and tooling becomes available. They have setup and exercised  the local database and the interfaces with the various GUIs.
