# 1st thing to point out is ... that there are a lot of us. 

(16) 14 /  if count I 20 count at the associate level almost half of the department ! 

dont know how good life can be without Scott! 
# This has been a great department to be part of. 

Scott has set the tone. 
# He has led by example through tough times:

Pandemic -> global conflict of course Title !X violation during ..
always had a sympathetic ear with the department head.  ... in ways both big and small

# I dont think I just speak for my self when I say that we have learned a lot from Scott.

leadership / decision making under pressure and uncertianty / now about moving on

# Scott, you will be missed.
So you will be missed, but certainly not forgotten. 

# To Scott !
