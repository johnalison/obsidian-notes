I am writing to enthusiastically support Sam Hobbeheydar’s application to your program. I first got to know Sam in the fall of 2023, when he began working as a researcher in my group. Sam came to me highly recommended by Prof. Chris Meyer (Indiana University), with whom he had collaborated as a high school student on several high-energy physics projects within the ATLAS collaboration. Through this experience, Sam developed strong skills in programming and machine learning.

Sam is currently contributing to our search for HH→bbWW with the CMS detector. This channel is promising, but faces substantial background from top quark production. Sam is working closely with a graduate student in my group to optimize the signal selection. He has implemented a simple baseline selection using engineered features and is now developing a multivariate selection using machine learning. Given the nature of this analysis, we anticipate a significant performance improvement with his machine learning approach. From the outset, Sam has operated at a level comparable to that of a graduate student. He excels at translating rough ideas into well-posed problems and then solving them efficiently.

In the spring, Sam will take on an additional computing project in our group: building a local Kubernetes cluster. Initially, we planned to hire a computer science student for this task, but Sam’s eagerness to learn, combined with his ability to tackle challenging technical projects, made him the perfect candidate.

In summary, Sam is quick to grasp new concepts and unafraid of hard work. He has a strong work ethic, practical problem-solving skills, and excellent intuition.  It seems to me that Sam Hobbeheydar is the exact type of student that you’re looking for in your program. He is creative, productive, and fun to work with.  While I would be thrilled for him to join your program, part of me will be sad as he won't spend that time in my group !

Sam is currently working with me on a search for HH->bbWW at the CMS detector. This channel is promising but suffers from large backgrounds from top quark production.  Sam is working on optimizing the signal selection with a graduate student in my group. He has implemented a simple base-line selection based on engineered features and is working on developing a multi-variate selection using machine learning. Given the nature of the problem we expect a significant improvement with the machine learning algorithm. From the beginning Sam has operated at a the level of a graduate student in my group. He is able to translate rough ideas into well-posed problems and then solve those problems. 

In the spring going to start a computing project in my group, building a local kubernetes cluster. This is work we were planning to hire a computer science student to complete. But given Sam's eagerness to learn and competence in executing hard technical tasks we went with him.

In summary, Sam is quick to catch on and willing to work hard. He has a great work ethic, good common sense, and excellent intuition. It seems to me that Sam Hobbeheydar is the exact type of student that you’re looking for in your program. He is creative, productive, and fun to work with. Part of me will be sad if he accepted into your program, because he won't spend that time in my group !
