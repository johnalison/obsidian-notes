I’m a senior PD in ATLAS leading some exciting high-dimensional inference methods for Higgs physics, see my recently seminar at CERN: [https://indico.cern.ch/event/1479992/](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1479992/). We improved our ability to reject mu=0 2.6x better. I’ll be visiting CMU on 3rd/4th Feb for a faculty interview with the statistics+data science department. I thought it would be a good opportunity to also connect with the particle physicists while I’m there. I could extend my stay by a day if there’s interest. What do you think?

  

The kind of [methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01600) I deploy in ATLAS might be interesting to several of you there. And I’ll likely have an interesting theory paper out by then as well (strangely connects back to statistics).

  

Best Regards,

Aishik
