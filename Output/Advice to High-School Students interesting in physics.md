I would say the best thing to do is get a solid grounding in the core physics material: eg: classical physics and E&M.   
  
These are very well covered in any of the various intro university physics books.   
  
Once you have read that I would recommend having a look at  
    "The Feynman lectures in physics"
These cover the same material in a much more advanced way.  
They can be very valuable even if you don't understand everything in them (even I still don't!)  
   
There are also very good books aimed at a general audience that you could read without having advanced classes.  My favorites are:  
  
  -) Steven Weinberg "Dreams of a Final theory"   
  -) Feynman "The character of physical law"  
  -) Richard Feynman "QED: The strange theory of light and matter"  
  
  
I would definitely have a look at those.
