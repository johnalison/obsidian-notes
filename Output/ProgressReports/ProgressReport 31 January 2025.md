(Short turn around since the last progress report, so this will be shorter but will hopefully get us back on the regular schedule).

My personal habits have been all good. I have started to ramp back up on lifting, but need to start working more kettle bells.  The diet has been in check and just finished another easy four-day fast. I have been playing some great basketball and have had lots of fun hanging out with Clay and Steve, will try to put more work in with them. 

I have realized that my biggest priority should be the placement of my people. At some level I knew this before, but in these past weeks I have really internalized it. Ive been putting a lot of work into Wes' postdoc application. Its really coming along; there is more work needed, but we will get there. I also put a decent amount of time into Manfred's letter, which is along the same lines. 

Chuyuan did his annual review.  It went very smooth, apparently there doesn't need to be someone outside of HEP on the these committee. This will make it go very smooth. He needs to get his thesis going and then starting thinking about what he wants to do afterwards.

The 4b progress has been steady. We have now understood the lower ZH sensitivity, it was from  missing the gg->ZH sample. We have have passed on to the L2 review and expect this to be smooth. The next steps are to try to model the synthetic data. This will be a great opportunity to really exercise the new FvT code. Chuyuan is working on a refit of the background with the finalized selection. Alejandro is looking into the kappa lambda scans, which are still not understood.  

HGC is ramping up. We are starting to make modules regularly. Josh will start next week and there has been movement on Ornella. I need to go through the other applications for the next round.
