I'm getting back into gear at the university. I've started teaching Modern Essentials and am looking forward to it. This is my second time through so its not a lot of work, but the lectures have been fun, I'm definitely better at it this round. One place I want to push is better homework problems. 

Exercise and diet have been OK, but I need to get back into lifting. This has lagged a bit because of injuries and lack of time on Tuesdays (w/kids) and Thursdays (department meetings). Meditation and glimpses needs work! 

I've started publishing on substack! Hopefully this will continue. The idea is to turn Zettlekasten notes into essays. So far, I have just published a few notes on their own and a book review. I think the posts need to be longer then individual notes. Its important that this doesn't become a burden. There should be no pressure; I'm using it as a playground.  I should check what works and use it to try to improve my thinking.

On 4b side, we have fixed the problem with the mixed data "unblinding".  The result now looks as expected (from the closure test). The only thing to really follow up on is the drop in ZH sensitivity, which Ill look into next. We then need to redo the background fits with an updated JCM and FvT.  This might not really be needed, but would be a good exercise. I have also done another iteration on the 4b synthetic datasets using the update Run3 calibration. This was actually a significant change, still waiting on feedback from Marina. I've added a few Run3 test to the CI. This pointed out a small non-reproducibility in the jet calibration. This remains unsolved after debugging for a couple of days. 

No analysis progress from Sindhu.  Chatted about some basic stats, but not much else.

Aniket is back from DAS, need to chat with him.

Wes' thesis basically done! Its definitely above bar, need to get him out.

I've started thinking about some good undergraduate projects: Universal Inference Toy and b-jet reclustering. Maybe get some action here ...
