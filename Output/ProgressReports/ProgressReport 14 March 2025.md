My habits have been all good. I'm seeing some gains with the new lifting strategy and will continue. I need more Zettlekasten and Mindfulness, I will try to get back to this after this busy period ends.  I gave a seminar at the University of Michigan. It was very nice to talk to Bing and Jainming, I told them how much they meant to me when I was first starting as a graduate student on ATLAS. Had a lot of good discussions with Christian; he told me the details of LDMX.

On the 4b side we have been making more steady progress. We have released another iteration of the AN and responded to Emmanuelle's comments. AE will give a talk in Hbb explaining the improved limit due to removing the anomalous events. We have another round of L2 comments to reply to, which should be quick.

I've beed doing a lot of debugging of the synthetic data with Marina. I fixed a calibration problem on my side and have implemented the Run-3 HH selection and CR definition, hopefully this will allow us to start comparing each other apples-to-apples.  An undergrad, Chance who is in my Physics 3, is starting to work on making the boosted synthetic data sets. He is making progress quickly. 

In SoS, we got the green light from the ARC and Wes will give the approval talk next week.

In bbWW, Aniket has code running in coffea25 and is waiting for a recipe to make ntuples with lower jet pt in the Run-3 samples.

The past two weeks have been slow for HGC. We are waiting for new tooling. However we now have the statement of work from FNAL for the multi-module teststand, so we should be able to start buying parts in ~2 weeks.
