Again seems like haven't been doing all that much "real work". On the 4b side we cut another version of the AN, but have a few things to follow up on (ZH change in sensitivity / mixed data fit qualities).  I believe I have now fixed the major problems with the Run-3 synthetic data.

On the HGC side. We are really starting to gear up for production. We have the chiller and the first round of tooling.  Parts are here to start 2/day in the new year!

We did 2/3 of the annual reviews (Wes and Sindhu).  Wes' was very smooth; he has a first draft of his thesis and should have his publications early in 25. He needs to focus on getting the pubs out and on postdoc applications.  Sindhu is strong on the upgrade work, but weak on analysis. I think the missing factor here is time.  Will recommend that she start prioritizing analysis (over other classes and HGC).  Overall the reviews have been very useful in setting students expectations. Really need to lean into these going forward. Chuyuan will do his in early 25.

Habits have been good. Did another fast. However I continue to struggle meditation and lifting. Lifting is partly slowed because of nagging injuries. Still, I could be doing more here.  On the meditation front I'd like to start really hammering on glimpses of "rigpa" in the transitional moments.

Lots of crypto excitement. Sold some pHex and am close to selling some more BTC.

Have really started to embrace the Libertarian ideology.
