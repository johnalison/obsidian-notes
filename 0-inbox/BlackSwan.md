The Black Swan Nassim Nicholas Taleb

Very Good!  (as expected)

- A small number of black swans explain almost everything in our world, from the success of idea and religions to the dynamics of historical events, to elements of our personal lives

- The central idea of this book concerns our blindness with respect to randomness, particularly the large deviations: Why do we scientists or nonscientists, hotshots or regular Joes, tend to see the pennies instead of the dollars?

- Black swan logic makes what you dont know far more relevant that what you do know

- The inability to predict outliers immplies the inability to predict the course of history.

- Black swans being unpredictable we need to adjust to their existence (rather than naively try to predict them) 

- The read free markets work is because they allow people to be lucky, thanks to aggressive trial and error, not by giving rewards or "incentives" for skill. 
  The strategy is, then to tinker as much as possible and try to collect as many Black Swan opportunities as you can.
  
- You cant assess the danger a criminal poses by examining only what he does on an ordinary day ? The normal is often irrelevant.

- Our world is dominated by the extreme, the unknown, and the very improbable (improbable according to our current knowledge) and all the while we spend our time engaged in small talk, focusing on the known, and the repeated. We need to use extreme events as the starting point and not treat it as an exception we can ignore. The future will be increasingly less predictable, while human nature and social "science" try to hide this from us.

- History is opaque. You see what comes out, not the script tha tproduces evetns, the generator of history 

  The studious examination of the past in the greatest of detail doesn not teach you much about the mind of History; it only give you the illusion of understanding it.
  Hist and societies do not crawl. They make jumps 
  
  [[History]]
  
- The American economy has leverged itself heavily on the idea generation, which explains why losing manufacturing jobs can be coupled with a rising standard of living. 

- Mediocristan: When your sample is large, no single instance will significantly change the aggregate or the total.
  Extremistan: inequalities are such that one single observation can disproportionately impact the aggregate, or the total.
  
- Extremistan can produce Black Swans, and does, since a few occurrences have had huge influences on history. This is the main idea of the book.

- In Mediocristan, you can be comfortable with what you have measured -- provided that you know for sure that it comes form Mediocristan. 
  You can also be comfortable with what you have learned from the data. Its not possible to have a black swan style suprises such that a single event can dominate a phenomenon. 
  
- In Extremistan you will have trouble figuring out the average from any sample since it can depend so much on one single observation. 
  The idea is not more difficult than that. Once unit can easily affect the total in a disproportionate way. 
  Here, you should always be suspicious of the knowledge you derive from data.
  Knowledge grows slowly and erratically with the addition of data, some of it extreme.
  
- Mediocristan: likely to be found in our ancestral environment
                you cna figure out whats going on after a while
				History crowls
				
  Extremistan:  likely to be found in our modern environment
	            takes long time to figure out whats going on
				History makes jumps
				
- Gray swans: scale-invariant, power lows, Paretian processes

- Mistaking a naive observation of the past as something definitive or representitive of the future is the one and only cause of our inability to understand the black swan.

- In the summer of 1982, large American banks lost close to all their past earnings (cumulatively) about everything they ever made in the history of American banking -- everything.

- The black swan is observer dependent. eg: the non-feeding on the 1000th day is a black swan for the turkey, not the butcher. 
  You can eliminate a Black Swan by science (if you can) or by keeping an open mind. 
  
- Knowledge doens not often elad to appropriate action because we tend to forget what we know, or forget how to process it properly if we do not pay attention, even when we are experts.

- People can mamage to effortlessly solve a problem in a social situation but struggle when it is presented as an abstract logical problem. 
  We tend to use different mental machinery -- so called module -- in differnet situations.
  
- Mathematicians will try to convince you that their science is useful to society by pointing out instances where it proved helpful, not those where it was a waste of time, or worse, those numerous application that inflicted a severe cost on society.
