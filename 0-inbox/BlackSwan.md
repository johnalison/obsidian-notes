The Black Swan Nassim Nicholas Taleb

Very Good!  (as expected)

- A small number of black swans explain almost everything in our world, from the success of idea and religions to the dynamics of historical events, to elements of our personal lives

- The central idea of this book concerns our blindness with respect to randomness, particularly the large deviations: Why do we scientists or nonscientists, hotshots or regular Joes, tend to see the pennies instead of the dollars?

- Black swan logic makes what you dont know far more relevant that what you do know

- The inability to predict outliers immplies the inability to predict the course of history.

- Black swans being unpredictable we need to adjust to their existence (rather than naively try to predict them) 

- The read free markets work is because they allow people to be lucky, thanks to aggressive trial and error, not by giving rewards or "incentives" for skill. 
  The strategy is, then to tinker as much as possible and try to collect as many Black Swan opportunities as you can.
  
- You cant assess the danger a criminal poses by examining only what he does on an ordinary day ? The normal is often irrelevant.

- Our world is dominated by the extreme, the unknown, and the very improbable (improbable according to our current knowledge) and all the while we spend our time engaged in small talk, focusing on the known, and the repeated. We need to use extreme events as the starting point and not treat it as an exception we can ignore. The future will be increasingly less predictable, while human nature and social "science" try to hide this from us.
