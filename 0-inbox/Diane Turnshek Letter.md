Dear Colleagues

I am happy to recommend that Diane Turnshek be reappointed as special lecture. I got to know Diane in 2019, when teaching the introductory lab courses and have worked closely with her in the departments outreach committee for the past five years. I strongly support her reappointment.  

Diane is outstanding in outreach; she does more for outreach than anybody in the department. 
She embodies the "everyone counts" motto, providing outreach for: elementary students, high-school students,  non-stem undergraduates,  high-school physics teachers, astronomy hobbyists, disabled veterans, and senior citizens.  She is constantly giving public talks and her work on the negative impacts of light pollution in the Dark-sky project as garnered national and international attention, from NPR to the Joe Rogan podcast.  Diane is effective and natural when discussing physics and astronomy to non-experts. She is good "behind the scenes" in coordinating events and is comfortable is the "star of the show".
