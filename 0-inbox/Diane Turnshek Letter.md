Dear Colleagues

I am happy to recommend that Diane Turnshek be reappointed as special lecture. I got to know Diane in 2019, when teaching the introductory lab courses and have worked closely with her in the departments outreach committee for the past five years. I strongly support her reappointment.  

Diane is outstanding in outreach; she does more for outreach than anybody in the department. 
She embodies the "everyone counts" motto, providing outreach for: elementary students, high-school students,  non-stem undergraduates,  high-school physics teachers, astronomy hobbyists, disabled veterans, and senior citizens.  She is constantly giving public talks and her work on the negative impacts of light pollution in the Dark-sky project as garnered national and international attention, from NPR to the Joe Rogan podcast.  Diane is effective and natural when discussing physics and astronomy to non-experts. She excels both as the "star of the show" and coordinating events "behind the scenes".  She is a great team player, helping many in the department execute their outreach projects, and a leader in projects of her own. Diane's outreach efforts are major asset to the department. 

I've also worked with Diane in her capacity of coordinating the department's demos. I have often used demos in Physics 3 and in outreach, when high-schools take field trips to campus. This is one area where there is room for improvement. If done right, physics demos can really be a gem of the department. I think its an area where our department could be doing a lot better
Many of our demos are old, marginally functional, and not specifically tailored to the courses we teach. The demo room is quite cluttered and disorganized, eg: I'm not sure it would pass the CMU safety inspections my lab goes through annually.  Diane manages to get by, but I would like to see this taking an a more prominent role in the department.  I think it wouldn't take much to develop a vibratnat demos program. Where we  try news things and evolve,  steal ideas from other departments, and have demos be a core of our department, not a cute party trick that thrown in on off days.  I think Diane is clearly the person to push on this front, given her connections with other physics teachers and outreach programs I'm sure should could be successfull if its clear this is a priority of the department. I would enourage us to push her in this direction.
