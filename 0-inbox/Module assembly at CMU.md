8796 full-size modules are required on the entire CE-H detector of which 
- 924 are HD full-size modules that will be assembled at UCSB.
- CMU will build 4240 LD : 120 losses to give 4120 LD :  3936 + 184 (test beam ?)
 **Pre-production**: Produce 360 with 240 modules being usable 5.8%


The cost of consumables and disposable items (HEPA filters, glue, epoxy, cleanroom overalls, gloves, galoshes, etc.) is borne by the project at an estimated cost of $34k per year based on prototyping experience
we assume a total of about 18 months of active cleanroom usage during module production.
