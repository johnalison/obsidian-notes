I've started lifting again, its slow and steady. I did a set of kettlebells and it felt great! I have a new lifting plan that I got from the Peter Attia podcast. I'm going to try to go hard for 30-45 mins with paired exercises that target different muscle groups. This will allow me to do the sets back-to-back with little or no rest in between.  Basketball has been good, I've been playing well and having fun. All habits are in check. I would say I still need some more meditation and would like to do more 4b work. My writing habits are steady.

On the four-b side we have been making nice progress. The lambda scan is now understood and looks as expected.  We got a round of comments from the L2 convener and have a first pass at the answers. There was nothing major, with some good points (eg: symmetric trigger weights systematics) and some action items to follow up on.  We got a significant improvement in the expected limits, now ~5.5,  after removing events with anomalously large signal weights.

Most of my work has been focused on the synthetic datasets. I've started doing the closure with one of the seeds. This has been an opportunity to test the new FvT code, the interface is very nice, much better than before. Im still debuggin the fits, but they seem to show the same problems that Marina is seeing with the Run3 synthetic datasets.  The next step is to isolate the phase space in the synthetic data that is the least well-modeled by the 3b. Im guessing that this will point to shortcomings of the synthetic data.  I have a good idea about how to improve the modelling of jet masses in the synthetic data, I will re-compute the masses based on the final pT. 

Aniket gave a great talk in bbWW! We will proceed with adding the low pT jets and will now move to doing this in Run-3. This will should bring much more integration with the rest of the group. 

Lots of steady progress on HGC. Ornella and Josh have started and we are moving on another Ad.  We have finalized a plan for the shipping containers and should will get new tooling soon.
