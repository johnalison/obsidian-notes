Started lifting again, slow and stead. DId a set of kettlebell and it felt great!
New idea from Attia podcast. Go hard for 30mins, pair exercises which target different muscle groups and dont  rest in between.  Basketball has been good. All habit in check. Need more meditation and more work. Writting coming along

Got L3 comments. Have first pass answers, some good point (eg: trigger weights ect).
Limit improved to ~5.5 after we correct the weights. 

Synthetic data closure.  FvT code very nice. interface much better than before. The fits to the synthetic data show the same problems as are seen in Run3. 
Will try to debug phase space
4b good idea about how to fix the masses
kappa lambda scans are now understood and look good 

HGC: 
- ornell and josh start. Cranking modules. Have bought a shiping container will get new tooling soon. Putting out another ad now.
