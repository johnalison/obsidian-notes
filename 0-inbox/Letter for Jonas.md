I am writing to strongly support Jonas Roemer's application for your program. 
Jonas has worked as a techincian in my lab for over a year and was student in an advanced physics laboratory coure that I taught. 
Jonas works well with others, is good both with his hands and with software, and is effective at defining and solving opened-ended problems.

I am a experimental particle physicist working on the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. 
At CMU, we are building a upgrade to the CMS detector, the High-Granularity Calorimeter, which involves assembling a bunch of 8-inch silicon modules -- essentially radiation-hard digital cameras. 
Each module is a stack of a Titanium baseplate, a silicon sensor, and a printed circuit board with readout electronics. 
We have setup a small manufacturing center on campus that will allow us to make 25 modules / day,  required to meet the schedule.
Module production will start in early 2025

Jonas has been 




MAC tasks: 
Worked closesly with graduate students and engineers
- completed cleanroom construction
- Operating the Gantr robot
- Fiducial finder: will save time. 
- Shelves ready: 4 x 10 × 5
- Get new carrying trays (Jonas: will do Xometry spark 30 modules)
- programming a custom GUI to interface with a data base
- optimzing workflow

Jonas Lab tech in our group


Jonas was a strong student in the Modern Physics Labarotry course, earning a B+.
Light Scattering
Neutron Activiation

Jonas is quick to catch on and willing to work hard. He has a great work ethic, good common sense, and excellent intuition.
It seems to me that Jonas Roemer is the exact type of student that you’re looking for in your program. 
He is creative, productive, and fun to work with. 
I’ll be sad to see him go; we could use more like him at CMU!
