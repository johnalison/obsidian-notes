Rong-Shyang mentioned in his talk at the MAC testing meeting that the  
MACs will be responsible for the equipment needed to supply the dry air  
for the MMTS. The specs for this dry air are more stringent than what  
we're using for our dry air storage cabinets, so at least at UCSB our  
current air dryer won't work for the MMTS.

Dry air requirements:
– dew point <-60C. vs (-16C to -19C at MACs)
– Minimum flow rate 60l/min = 2.1cfm
– Recommended 120l/min = 4.2 cfm

Options: Manual Dessicant vs Regenerative Heatless

Regenarative Heatless: 
uses pressure swing adsorption (PSA). The operation is fully automatic and relatively little
maintenance is required

Cost : $2000-$4000
