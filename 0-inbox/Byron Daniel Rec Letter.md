Dear Colleagues

I am happy to recommend Byron Daniel for the CMU Graduate Student Service Award. I first got to know Bryon in 2021 while running the High-School Physics Teachers program and have worked with him in the departments outreach committee for several years.

Educational outreach beyond the university is critical to growing and diversifying the STEM workforce.

Outreach targeting high-school teachers, instead of the students directly, promises a bigger return on invest- ment; getting high-school science teachers excited and fluent in state-of-the-art research and techniques will


The goal for the first stage is to hold an annual week-long summer program – in conjunction with the opening week of PGSS – that brings together high-school teachers to CMU’s campus. The program will educate teachers about data science and machine learning, provide resources and takeaways they can use in class, and highlight career opportunities for students trained in data science. Various topics, with hands-on activities, will be covered that will allow the teachers to connect data science to real-world applications. Teams of teachers and CMU students and faculty will work together to design lecture content and create activities for high-school classrooms. We will start by focusing on: a week of data science content for computer science students, a week of content for STEM students, an activity analyzing the CMS open data — building off the PGGS team project discused above. In subsequent years, we will design a new data science course for high-school students and develop machine learning activities for biology, chemistry, and physics classes. At the end of the week, the teachers will present their materials to the group and make them available to everyone to use in their classrooms. This will create a library of demonstrations available to all teachers. The program will also create a professional network of Pittsburgh-area STEM teachers and Carnegie Mellon faculty who can act as resources and collaborators for future projects.


Earlier this summer (June 26th – 29th), I organized a pilot of the program. The event brought 15 Pittsburgh-area high-school physics teachers – from a broad mix of schools: both public and private, urban and suburban – to the CMU’s campus for a four-day workshop. The teachers toured labs, were shown demonstrations used in introductory CMU courses, and were given overviews of research in various physics sub-disciplines. We held discussion sessions on how we can help teachers to better motivate high-school students to pursue careers in STEM. We also gathered teacher input – from both informal discussion and written surveys – on how best to shape our program in coming years. Teachers participating in the program earned continuing education credits required by the state.


# Letter from Rachel

 [Graduate Student Service Award](https://www.cmu.edu/celebration-of-education/graduate-student-service/index.html), and they have extended the deadline to February 28th and encouraged more nominations.  Markus had a suggestion that I thought was very good - Byron Daniel has done a lot of service work of a formal and informal nature serving the department and beyond, and we're going to nominate him.

  
Byron worked with you on the teacher training program and other outreach (e.g., to public school contacts).  Would you be able to provide either a supporting quote or letter, or suggest some supporting material we can include with the nomination (e.g., material he developed for outreach programs)?  

Unfortunately to meet this deadline we would like to have material by Weds night 2/26 so we can put it together and submit on Friday, but I hope some of this might be easy-ish to put together.
