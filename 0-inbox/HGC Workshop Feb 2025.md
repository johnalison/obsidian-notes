# Intro slides Karl
Expect v3d to be usable everywhere in the system, with SEE to TOA to be managed as a feature
• Transition to module assembly with v3d once validated (by summer)
v3e with SEE resistant TOA IP block, design in work 
• Would like to complete the detector with this chip once qualified, and this will be only in 12m (if things go smoothly!)
