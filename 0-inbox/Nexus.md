A brief history of Information Networks and from the stone age to AI.

Yuval Noah Harari


- So far (up to ch4) less dense than his other books.

## Prologue

-)  The lesson to the apprentice -- and to humanity -- is clear: never summon powers you cannot control

-) The tendency to create powerful things with unintended consequesnces started not with the invention of the steam engine or AI but with the invention of religion

-)  Power alway stems from cooperation between large numbers of humans

-)  The main argument of this book is that humankind gains enormous power by building large networks of cooperation, but the way these networks are built predisposes us to use that power unwisely. Our problem, then is a network problem.

-)  It is an information problem. Information is the glue that holds networks together. But for 10 of thousands of year, Sapiens built and maintained large networks by inventing and spreading fictions, fantasies, and mass delusions.

-)  The niave view of information: by gathering and processing much more information than individuals can, big networks achieve a better undersstanding of medicine, physics, economics, and numerous other fields, which makes the network not only powerful but wise. This view posits that in sufficient quantities information leads to truth, and truth in turn leads to both power and wisdom.  

Ignorance-- on this account-- leads nowhere. While delusional or deceitful networks might arise in moments of crisis, in the long-term they are bout to lose to more clear-sighted and honest rivals. 

The bigger the information network, the closer it must be to the truth.

-) Yet, with all the information currently circulating at breathtaking speeds, humanity is closer than ever to annihilating itself.

-) Given the magnitude of the danger, AI should be of interest to all human beings.

AI is the first technology in history that can make decisions and create new ideas by itself.

AI is not a tool, its an agent.

-) Homo Deus argued that the real hero of history has always been information, rather than Homo spaiens

-) What we usually think of as ideological and political conflicts often turn out to be clashes between opposing types of information networks.

-) Judged in terms of longevity, spread, and power, the Catholic Church has been perhaps the most successful institution in human history, despite -- or perhaps because of -- the relative weakness of its self-correcting mechanisms. 

-)  The rise of AI is arguably the biggest information revolution in history. 

-) History isnt the study of the past, it is the study of change. [[History]]

JA: Communism as a negative example of AI alignment ?

-) A deep knowledge of history is vital to understand what is new about AI, how it is fundamentally different from printing presses and radio sets, and in what specific ways an AI dictatorship could be very unlike anything we have seen before. 

-) The whole point of writing this book is that by making informed choices we can prevent the worst outcomes.

# Chapter 1: What is Information?

-) most information is not an attempt to represent reality. Most information does not represent anything

-) Truth is something that brings our attention to certain aspects of reality while inevitably ignoring other aspects.

-) Errors, lies, fantasies, and fictions are information too. Contrary to the Naive View of Information, information has no essential link to truth. Information creates new realities by tying together disparate things.  Information doesnt necessarily inform us about things, it puts things in formation. 

-) If the main job of information has been to represent reality accurately, it would have been hard to explain why the Bible became one of the most influential texts in history. 

-) When we look at the history of information, we see a constant rise in connectivity without a concomitant rise in truthfulness or wisdom.
