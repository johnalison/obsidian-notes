A brief history of Information Networks and from the stone age to AI.

Yuval Noah Harari


- So far (up to ch4) less dense than his other books.

## Prologue

-)  The lesson to the apprentice -- and to humanity -- is clear: never summon powers you cannot control

-) The tendency to create powerful things with unintended consequesnces started not with the invention of the steam engine or AI but with the invention of religion

-)  Power alway stems from cooperation between large numbers of humans

-)  The main argument of this book is that humankind gains enormous power by building large networks of cooperation, but the way these networks are built predisposes us to use that power unwisely. Our problem, then is a network problem.

-)  It is an information problem. Information is the glue that holds networks together. But for 10 of thousands of year, Sapiens built and maintained large networks by inventing and spreading fictions, fantasies, and mass delusions.

-)  The niave view of information: by gathering and processing much more information than individuals can, big networks achieve a better undersstanding of medicine, physics, economics, and numerous other fields, which makes the network not only powerful but wise. This view posits that in sufficient quantities information leads to truth, and truth in turn leads to both power and wisdom.  

Ignorance-- on this account-- leads nowhere. While delusional or deceitful networks might arise in moments of crisis, in the long-term they are bout to lose to more clear-sighted and honest rivals. 

The bigger the information network, the closer it must be to the truth.

-) Yet, with all the information currently circulating at breathtaking speeds, humanity is closer than ever to annihilating itself.

-) Given the magnitude of the danger, AI should be of interest to all human beings.

AI is the first technology in history that can make decisions and create new ideas by itself.

AI is not a tool, its an agent.

-) Homo Deus argued that the real hero of history has always been information, rather than Homo spaiens

-) What we usually think of as ideological and political conflicts often turn out to be clashes between opposing types of information networks.

-) Judged in terms of longevity, spread, and power, the Catholic Church has been perhaps the most successful institution in human history, despite -- or perhaps because of -- the relative weakness of its self-correcting mechanisms. 

-)  The rise of AI is arguably the biggest information revolution in history. 

-) History isnt the study of the past, it is the study of change. [[History]]

JA: Communism as a negative example of AI alignment ?

-) A deep knowledge of history is vital to understand what is new about AI, how it is fundamentally different from printing presses and radio sets, and in what specific ways an AI dictatorship could be very unlike anything we have seen before. 

-) The whole point of writing this book is that by making informed choices we can prevent the worst outcomes.

# Chapter 1: What is Information?

-) most information is not an attempt to represent reality. Most information does not represent anything

-) Truth is something that brings our attention to certain aspects of reality while inevitably ignoring other aspects.

-) Errors, lies, fantasies, and fictions are information too. Contrary to the Naive View of Information, information has no essential link to truth. Information creates new realities by tying together disparate things.  Information doesnt necessarily inform us about things, it puts things in formation. 

-) If the main job of information has been to represent reality accurately, it would have been hard to explain why the Bible became one of the most influential texts in history. 

-) When we look at the history of information, we see a constant rise in connectivity without a concomitant rise in truthfulness or wisdom. 

# Chapter 2: Stories: Unlimited Connections

- We Sapiens rule the worl not because we are so wise but because we are the only animals that can cooperate flexibly in large numbers.

- About 70,000 years ago, Homo Sapiens bands began displaying an unprecedented capacity to cooperate with one another. Waht enabled different bands to cooperate is that evolutionary changes in brain structure and lunguistic abilities apparently gave Sapiens the aptitude to tell and believe fictional stories and to be deeply moved by them. 

- Prior to the emergence of stories the universe contained just two levels of reality. Stories added a third. The first two levels are objective reality and subjective reality. The new level is inter-subjective reality. 

- Luckily, since history is shaped by intersubjective stories, sometimes we can avert conflict and make peace by talking with people, changing the stories in which they and we believe, or coming up with a new story that everyone can accept. 

- What the people at the top know, which nuclear physicists dont always, is that telling the truth about the universe is hardly the most efficient way to produce order among large numbers of people. When it comes to uniting people, fiction enjoys two inherent advantages over the truth. First, fiction can be made as simple as we like, whereas the truth tends to be complicated. Second, the truth is often painful and disturbing, and if we try to make it more comforting it will no longer be the truth.

# Chapter 3: The Bite of the Paper Tigers

- Long-term human memory is particularly adapted to retaining stories. 

- Like mythology, bureaucracy too tends to sacrifice truth for order

- Mythology and bureaucracy are the twin pillary of every large-scale society.

- Artists usually work with a limited set of story lines that are rooted in our biology, but none of these dramas sheds much light on the workings of bureaucracy, because they have all been scripted by evolution millions of years before the emergence of documents and archives. 

- All powerful information networks can do both good and ill, depending on how they are designed and used. Merely increasing the quantity of information in a network doesnt gaurantee its benevolence, or make it any easier to find the right balance between truth and order.

- Holy books like the Bible and the Quran are an information technology that is meant to both include all the vital information society needs and be free from all possibility of error.
  What happens when an information network believes itself to be utterly incapable of any error ? 
  The history of allegedly infallible holy books highlights some of the limitations of all information networks and holds important lessons for the attemmpt to create infallible AIs in the 21st C.
  
  
# Chapter 4: Errors: The Fantasy of Infallibility

- TruthGPT: In previous eras, such fantasies took a different form -- religion. 
  Historically, the most important function of religion as been to provide superhuman legitimacy for the social order. 
  Studying the history of religion is thus highly relevant to present-day debates about AI.
  
- The book became an important religious technology in the 1st C BCE. 
  After 10s of thousands of years in which gods spoke to humans via shamans, priests, prophets, oracles, and other human messengers, religious movements like Judaism began arguing that the gods speak through this novel technology of the book.
