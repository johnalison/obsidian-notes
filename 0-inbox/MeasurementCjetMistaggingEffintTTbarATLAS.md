- A technique is presented to measure the efficiency with which c-jets are mistagged as bjets (mistagging efficiency) using 𝑡𝑡 ̄ events,

- The measurement utilises the relatively large and known W->cs branching ratio,

- Events are reconstructed using a kinematic likelihood technique which selects the mapping between jets and tt decay products that yields the highest likelihood value.

- The distribution of the btagging discriminant for jets from the hadronic Wdecays in data is compared with that in simulation to extract the mistagging efficiency as a function of jet transverse momentum. 

- The technique has the advantage that it does not depend on a specific hadron decay chain topology.
