Insight gained from the direct approach of meditation -- ie: directly examining who or what you are -- can fundamentally change your perception of yourself and reality. 

Insight or awakening is the realization that [[Our Default Point of View]] is not who we really are. 
Instead, we see that -- experientially -- we are really a pure subjective presence: a view of the world, not a thing in the world.




[[We are a point of view, not a separate thing]]
