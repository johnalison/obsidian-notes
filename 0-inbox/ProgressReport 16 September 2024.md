Still no drinking, gong well! Lots of detailed debugging and getting code stable / usable. I migrated the trigger code to python and give a second, more detailed, presentation of the JetDeclustering method to Hbb.

Still need to improve meditation, would like to do this in the morning. I will give this a try when sleeping back to normal (Its messed up now because of Henrys surgery.) Also want to focus on Stoic Test Challenge. 

# 4b
Progress in the last two weeks has been at the high-level and low-level. At the high-level I polished the slides and gave a presentation of the ideas. This is a good starting point to introduce the idea. Most of the progress and work has been at the low-level.  I migrated the TriggerEmulator to python, propagated btagging scores, and got the new synthetic dataset code running on MC. I added CI tests, which uncovered errors. This led to a massive debugging campaign. The fixes were not major, but we now have reproducible code.  More recently I have added the pseudodata making module. Next steps is to proceed to making datasets for closure.

AE is reproducing current results with new skims.  Once OK, will proceed to low-pt analysis 

Sindhu is making slow, but steady progress on X->HH->4b. I need to push more in this area.

Chuyuans paper has now been accepted, I need him to help me with the FvT fitting and then get going on his thesis. 

# HGC
Slow time as not much is going with modules.  I think we have a better handle on IV curves, (only one bad module). Schedule already slipped, will now do 4 module/day in November (not October as planned in August!) Jonas will focus on the Gantry. 

# bbWW
Aniket still making progress.  Chi2 now makes sense and we are using a more reasonable processor.  Hopefully this can accelerate soon.

# Semi-Supervised 
Submitted Abstract 
Soheun seeing bad closure in background only model. This needs to be understood before we can really move on.  He had some idea re: correcting the bias, but these seem crazy to me.
