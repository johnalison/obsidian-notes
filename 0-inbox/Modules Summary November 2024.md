UCSB site visits to CMU and TTU. The visits were very productive in synchronization of MACâ€™s: programs, procedures, QC, and DB.  Also allowed for detailed planning of production ramp-up in next few months.
 
Final gantry tooling ordering has begun. The first pieces have been received exceed the specification requirements. 

UCSB: has built 5 LD Right partials on Ti baseplate (v3b chip) for an irradiation campaign.
Each module has undergone 10 thermal cycles +20C/-40C and are currently in Croatia to be irradiated to 50 MRad.

CMU has built 2 LD full modules, 1 CF baseplate and 1 CTu baseplate.  We are currently Interviewing technicians. There is one offer out and will likely make two more within the month.
Module testing has running smoothly as we wait for first preproduction run.  There has also been lots of nice development of the database in advance of production ramp-up.
