# Pre-Production Planning (Alethea)
- Wrapping up preseries
- UCSB build 5 LD right for irradiation campaign
- CMU done with pre-series

- Waiting for hexaboards hope for Nov.  Limit by ROC availability 
- Calendar 
	- Nov: 2 modules /day x week (one gantry tray). 
	- Dec: 4/day x week (one gantry tray)
	- Jan-Feb recieve tooling and multi-module test stands
	- March: 4 /day for 4 days
	- April:    8 /day for 4 days
	- May:   12 /day for 4 days 	- 

(What does preproduction mean ? Could go on the detector... 3b chips.. number produced still less than the number of spares)

# ESD susceptibility of Hexaboards (Fakri)
- confirmed source of dead half chip is due to ESD damage
- Capacitance of silicon 47 pF
- Maybe apply a shunt during assembly?

# Glue/Encapsulation studies (Chiara)
-  first a module with no epoxy on the perimeter has been built and thermal cycled
- All the modules built with the new glue/tape pattern do not show noisy channels identified during assembling procedure 
- Covering CM capacitor with encapsulant helps protecting chips against failures - This should be done before getting hexaboard to MACs since is time consuming

# Engineering update
- US MAC Assembly tooling order: Xometry ~16 days
- (Asia MACs Xometry also ?)

# Baseplates
-
