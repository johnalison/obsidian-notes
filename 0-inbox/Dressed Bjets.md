Nice way to think about events with additional non bjets. The b-jets are "dressed" by the non-b jets that cluster into them before the b-s cluster among themselves. We can think of the clustering in two steps: first the b-s are dressed, then the dressed bs are clustered. After dressing, there are 4 dressed b jets that are clustered in the same way that the 4 b-jets are clustered in the 4b + 0j events.

The dressing preserves both multiplicity and clustering history.
