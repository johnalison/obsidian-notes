**HGC General**: Given recent report of ATLAS silicon modules cracking, have studied of combination baseplate material to minimize Si stresses. Titanium promising in terms of Si stresses and forces. Expect minimal impact on assembly, tooling , and mounting. An order titanium plates as been placed.

UCSB: Built more than 5 HD modules and have exercised producing two at a time. 

UCSB: Built new HD module with Alumina Baseplate. Observed and studying some noisy channels.

TTU built 4 additional modules with good dimensional and electrical performance characteristics
(CF baseplates with hybrid gluing)

TTU is starting the process to place orders for the gantry tooling for the US MACs

CMU  placed order for 300 foam inserts for the US MACs for module shipping. 200 for LD-Full and 100 for HD-Full. Will be sufficient for the remainder of pre-series and the ramp-up

CMU Currently assembling two modules at a time.  (CF baseplate and hybrid gluing)

CMU Working towards singular LabView codebase across all MACs. Assisting other MACs local database used during assembly.

---------------

CMU 10 LD full on C-fiber for FNAL (phase 1) • 
TTU 10 LD full on C-fiber for FNAL (phase 1)
• TTU build 4 LD full modules with irradiated sensors
• UCSB finish first 11 HD full C-fiber modules for FNAL (phase 1)
