Dear Colleagues, 


I am writing to strongly support Manfred Pauliniâ€™s nomination for the Barbara Lazarus Award. I have worked closely with Manfred since joining Carnegie Mellon as an Assistant Professor of Physics six years ago. It is hard for me to overemphasize how much Manfred has meant to me in this time. He has been a constant source of inspiration and has made me a more effective researcher, teacher, and colleague.

I am an experimental particle physicist working on the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). CMS is one of two major experiments at the LHC; the other is called ATLAS. These experiments are composed of thousands of engineers and physicists who have been collaborating for over two decades. Joining CMU meant transitioning from ATLAS - an experiment I had been a member of for over ten years - to CMS, the big "cross town" rival. Moving experiments requires adjusting to new people, a different work culture, and unfamiliar (often opaque) collaboration politics. This alone would be daunting enough, not to mention that we are talking about large collections of physicists, not typically the most graceful social animals. Manfred shepherded me through this transition with ease. He knew precisely how cut through unnecessary red tape and enabled me to make the right connections at the right times.

I also work closely with Manfred on research at CMU. We are co-leading a project on campus that will build over 5000 sophisticated detector components to upgrade CMS. This project requires years of planning and preparation before assembly can begin. Throughout the past year and a half we have hired and on-boarded personnel, designed and constructed a class 10000 clean-room, and procured several major pieces of equipment needed for production. Manfred's deep knowledge of the university and department has allowed us to make rapid progress efficiently and effectively. Without his guidance, I would have had to divert precious time spent growing as a researcher and educator into understanding and navigating university bureaucracy.



In conclusion, Manfred has skillfully guided me on matters big and small. He is caring, has good common sense, and excellent intuition. It seems to me that Manfred Paulini is the exact type of person that you are looking to honor with this award. Manfred has set the bar that I strive to achieve with those I mentor. If someday I could be to a new junior CMU faculty what Manfred has been to me, I would consider it a major accomplishment.
