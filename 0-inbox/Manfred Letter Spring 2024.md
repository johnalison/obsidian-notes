Dear Colleagues, 


I am writing to strongly support Manfred Paulini’s nomination for the Barbara Lazarus Award. I have worked closely with Manfred since joining Carnegie Mellon as an Assistant Professor of Physics six years ago. It is hard for me to overemphasize how much Manfred has meant to me in this time. He has been a father figure and a constant source of inspiration. Manfred has made me a more effective researcher, teacher, and colleague. 

I am an experimental particle physicist working on the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). CMS is one of two major experiments at the LHC; the other is called ATLAS. These experiments are composed of thousands of engineers and physicists who have been collaborating for over two decades. When I joined CMU I transitioned from ATLAS - on which I worked as a graduate student and a postdoc  - to CMS, the big "cross town" rival. Moving experiments requires adjusting to new people, a different work culture, and unfamiliar (and often opaque) collaboration politics. This alone would be daunting enough, not to mention that we are talking about large collections of physicists -- not typically the most graceful social animals. Manfred shepherded me through this transition with ease. He knew precisely how to cut through unnecessary red tape and enabled me to make the right connections at the right times.

I work very closely with Manfred on research at CMU. I interact with him daily, from big picture planning our DOE grant to the mundane decisions about CMS software. We have formal meeting three times a week to discuss on going projects and meet informally with the other CMS faculty for lunch of Firdays. Manfred's energy nad positive energy is contagious. [Add a few more sentance about how good of a group leader he is here]

We have formal meetings three times a week to discuss ongoing projects and meet informally with the other CMS faculty for lunch on Fridays. Manfred’s energy and positivity are contagious. [Rare to find groups CMS or ATLAS wehre everyone gets along.] He has a unique ability to foster a collaborative group dynamic. Manfred has built a research environment that encourages curiosity and innovation, ensuring that every team member feels valued and supported. His mentorship style blends encouragement with thoughtful guidance, empowering each of us to grow both personally and professionally.

Manfred and I are co-leading a project on campus that will build over 5000 sophisticated detector components to upgrade the CMS detector. This project requires years of planning and preparation before assembly can begin. Throughout the past year and a half we have hired and on-boarded personnel, designed and constructed a class 10000 clean-room, and procured several major pieces of equipment needed for production. Manfred's deep knowledge of the university and department has allowed us to make rapid progress efficiently and effectively. Without his guidance, I would have had to divert precious time spent growing as a researcher and educator into understanding and navigating the university bureaucracy.

Manfred’s mentorship extends far beyond logistics and technical guidance. He is deeply invested in the success and well-being of those he mentors. He has a remarkable ability to recognize potential and push individuals toward achieving their best, while always providing a safety net of support. His unwavering dedication to the professional development of his colleagues and students has created a legacy that will undoubtedly extend well beyond his immediate sphere of influence.

In conclusion, Manfred has skillfully guided me on matters big and small. He is caring, has good common sense, and excellent intuition. It seems to me that Manfred Paulini is the exact type of person that you are looking to honor with this award. Manfred has set the bar that I strive to achieve with those I mentor. If someday I could be to a new junior CMU faculty what Manfred has been to me, I would consider it a great accomplishment. Manfred has had -- by far -- the biggest impact on my career since joining CMU. I am lucky to get to work with him!
