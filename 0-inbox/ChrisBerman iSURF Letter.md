Dear iSURF Committee, 

I am writing to strongly support Chris Berman's application for a CMU iSURF position. Chris is proposing to build on his this summer as part of the SURF program. The case to continue this work internationally is natural and compelling. The experiment is located at CERN in Geneva Switzerland and many of the relevant experts are based at the lab full time. As detailed below, these experts are precisely what is needed to take Chris's work to the next level. This fellowship would be of significant benefit not only to to Chris, but to my group at CMU and the CMS collaboration.
 
Chris came to me last semester highly recommended by Tudor Manole, a statistics graduate student whom I collaborate with on research. Chris spent a semester doing background reading and obtaining the necessary credentials to collaborate on the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

Chris worked for the summer on a project that is both important and timely. I study Higgs boson production at colliders. One of the current missing pieces in our understanding of the Higgs boson is how (or indeed if) it interacts with strange quarks. This interaction is predicted by our best theory -- the Standard Model of particle physics -- but has yet to be observed. Observing this interaction is challenging, but identifying strange quarks in our detectors is hard.   The detectors at the LHC are not designed to tell strange quarks from other more commonly produced particles. However, we are currently in the processes of designing next-generation detectors for an electron-position collider. This would be the ideal environment to detect strange quarks and we currently have the opportunity to design a detector for the job.

The goal of Chris’s work is understand how the trade-offs in the future detector design would affect our ability to identify strange quarks. He started by analyzing the best case scenario, of a perfect detector. This work established a well-understood baseline against which we can cross check future results. This work allowed Chris to make connections and plans for future collaboration with scientists at CERN.
This work is a natural extension of Chris' work for the SURF last summer 
completed a SURF in the summer of 2024. 


There is also the opportunity to go beyond the previous studies using more advanced machine learning tools (attention-based networks) He will then go on to implement the degradation in performance that can be expected in a realistic detector. This studies will be critical to understand how should optimize the next-generation detectors to measure this important signal.

This work will be done in collaboration with a research group at CERN, which I convene.  Work can and will be done on CMU’s campus, and our results will be presented to the collaboration.

Please feel free to contact me to further discuss Chris’s project.
