- Why free markets? MAKE THIS A NOTE!!
	- No completely free markets, but all the rich countries have had something like a free market for a long time
	- There have been several instances of completely unfree markets (socialism) has been tried and it is clear that it leads to utter failure
	- No indication that having too much freedom is a problem (Is this really true ? Why are )
	- US doing better than Europe (economy and immigration destination) b/c freer system
