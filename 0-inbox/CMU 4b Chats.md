- CL: finishing background fits
- SM: putting slides together

- AE working comments 
- CL: fitting new background method
- SM: not much


[[31 January 2025 Friday]]
- CL some nice SvB Studies ... Working on new background fit
- AE: Still dont understand klambda fits...<font color=red> NOW SOLVED!!! </font>
- JA: will make 15x synthetic data and try to run the closure
- Will get instructions on friend trees from AE and fitting FvT from CL


[[24 January 2025 Friday]]
- SvB gains from adding other signal k_l points looks real but small. 
- Will check stat only... if promising compute systematics
- In parallel CL, will refit FvT x 15 kfolds.
