On the HGCal upgrade side Sindhu designed, advocated for, and implemented a local set up a database ecosystem for silicon module assembly. 

Two
- This is not a sexy project. 
- Initially faced signifiant opposition from her advisor and later from the rest of the MACs. She faught for her idea, and won me over. She then won over the larger MAC group. This was not easy as it required real work to be done by the other groups. In the end Sindhu convinced them that the addition work was well worth it. 

I couldnt image RAMP up with out the local database. 
Central DB cannot support what 
Ad hoc, costly, unscrichronized home grown solutions. 
Sindhu forsaw this and mitigated this risk. 


The database will be used to track and archive information about the tens of thousands of parts used in assembly. 
She has created tools using Python, LabVIEW, and OGP Software that allow parts tracking at different stages of assembly, i.e. inspection, assembly, wirebonding. 
She also devised a framework to import/export this data during production from/to CERN. 
These tools will be implemented at all six silicon module assembly centers.

The committee was very impressed with the progress Sindhu has made, particularly with the HGC upgrade project.  
She has defined and executed projects to completion on her on initiative. 
This has required creativity and perspective. In this domain she is already operating at the level of a postdoc. 

This is not a sexy project. 
But it is essential to understanding what we have done and to unsure quality control.
