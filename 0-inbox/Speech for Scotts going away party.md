I am going to say a few words on behalf of the Junior faculty. 

1st thing to point out is ... that there are a lot of us. 
Ive counted successfully hired (16) 14 /  if count I 20 count at the associate level almost half of the department ! 

So ... For most of us, Scott was the only department head we knew. 
We dont know how good life can be without Scott! 

This department has been a great department to be part of. 
Everyone is sensible and its fun to work in.
Scott has set the tone. 

He has by example through tough times:
- Global pandemic .... led to closing of of the University 
- Student unrest from international wars
- of course the ... eh ... Title 9 violation during the Title 9 meeting !

Junior faculty have always had a sympathetic ear with the department head. 
And Scott has really made our ramping up easy...  in ways both big and small.

I dont think I just speak for my self when I say that we have learned a lot from Scott.
- Alot about leadership
- about decision making under pressure and under uncertainty 
- and about moving on

Scott, you will be missed.
For us -- like it our not -- you will be the standard with all other department heads will be judged!
So you will be missed, but certainly not forgotten. 

Thank you!
