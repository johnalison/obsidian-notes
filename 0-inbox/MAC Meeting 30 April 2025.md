# Hexaboards
- 530 / 600 LD boards (w/v3c) passed the QC
- Dead 1/2 chips !!!
- ~170 coming soon. Will go through FNAL

# Alethea
- Bonding notes: 
- Encapsulant level should not exceed the top of the hexaboard • Look at the module from the side, there should be no dome of encapsulant
- Backside bonds: • More is better
