Two variances:

- 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2
- 402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB

# 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2
There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$215k in the cost account 
402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly at CMU.  The variance has two pieces:
1) -64k Variance from the Assembly of Proto-2 Modules 51-100
2) -140k from the assembly of the first batch of modules (1 - 80)


For the preseries, although $365k of work has been earned, the schedule is behind the $428 expected. This is due to missing input parts: hexaboards and baseplates. 

Similarly, the production of the first 80 full-sized modules is delayed because of missing input parts. 

It is expected that CMU will start the assembly of modules once parts will become available.

# 402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB
Cumulative SV of $333k 
- 75k from Assembly of odd-sized preseries 
- 245k from assembly/shipping of odd -sized modules (1% - 8%)
- 12k Â Cleanroom consumables


Cumulative CV of 190k
Partial cancellation of 
$210 earned with prototype-1 mudles
