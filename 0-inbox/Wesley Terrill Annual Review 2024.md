Waiting on Wes...

# Summary of research plan and recommendations of committee:

The committee was impressed with Wes' progress, both on the analysis side and with the HGC upgrade project. In particular, the presentation of the analysis was significantly improved. 

The committee recommends that Wes focus on getting his papers (HGC testing and Low-pt lepton + MeT search) published. In parallel, he should focus on "end-game": set a thesis defense date, write draft of the thesis, and start preparing post-doc applications. We would also encourage Wes to give talks/seminars at a number of universities after back from CERN.
