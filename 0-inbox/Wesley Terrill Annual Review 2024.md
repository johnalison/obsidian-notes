# Summary of research progress within past year. 

Waiting on Wes...

# Summary of research plan and recommendations of committee:

We should focus on getting his papers (HGC testing and Low-pt lepton search) published. In parallel he should focus on "end-game".  Set a thesis defense date. Prepare a draft of the thesis and start preparing post-doc applications. We would also encourage Wes to give talks/seminars at a number of universities after back from CERN.
