There has been a lot going on!  On one hand it feels like not that much at all has been happening and on the other it seems like a lot is coming together; slow burn paying off for a lot of stuff. First, habit have all been good, could use some more meditation. 

Lately, I've been putting a lot of effort into process. Ive really been ramping up the with AI; Ive re-upped perplexity, signed up for Claude, and started using MCPs to integrate with my obsidian note.   However the biggest changes has been that I've migrated from emacs to Cursor. This has been a big investment that is already starting to pay off; it has agent mode that can translate natural language prompts into action.

My social life has continued at a high pace. We tried out a new baby sitter (Maddy) and had a date night.  Heather Gray visited for a colloquium. It was genuinely nice to see her, was not jealous; race against yourself.   

Lots of good news. Manfred got the Lazarus Mentoring Award! I was really happy to see this. It was a nice opportunity to tell Manfred what he has meant to me. ATLAS and CMS got the breakthrough prize ! Great to see this non-trivial recognition in the field for the "slow burn" work that we've been doing.  I was also asked by  Daniela Bortoletto to be an external examiner for an Oxford PhD student doing bbττ. I assume this was a direct result of my LHCP HH talk.

On the prospective student from Christian Brody-Guinto has accepted! I was pleased that we beat out Wisconsin, one of the strongest groups on CMS.  I also surprisingly got a student from the Masters program: Lei Zhao. Not sure why he applied to the masters and not the PhD programs (Sufie things it could have been because of the longer deadline...) Hopefully, I can make it worth it for him. I plan to have him start by looking into making the real synthetic data for boosted events, would also be a good place to plugin with Chance. 

Now to actual work... on the 4b side I have slowly proceeding on the cutflow comparison with Marina. This has been slow going partly because fo the shift to Cursor and partly for real problems I've been encountering. Speed should pick up here soon.  I did the bootstrapping studies. These were quicker and gave clearer answer than I was expecting. I really should have done this a while ago. I did it both for the synthetic datasets and the mixed data, with good results in both cases. We pushed the L2 for unblinding and got a couple of comments back from Meng. These have now been answered and we are again asking to take the next step. 

The SoS result was shown at Moriond QCD !  Only the prompt for now, we will followup with the displaced in the paper.  I really dont understand were the 5 sigma local excess is coming from. Wes gave his FNAL practice talk and had his interview. He says it went well. He defends his thesis on Monday!

HGC cranking out modules. 
Jonas leaving... Ads out 
Jim Accepts h... Starting HGC talk
Can start buying MMTS supplies
FNAL trip is real... Starting to prepare slides will be good to really wrap my head around whats going on with the upgrades
