# 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2

Schedule VAriance 
- -221k
	- - 60k  Assemble and test 1-80 
	- - 140k: 81-240
	- - 17k cleanroom consumables

There is a schedule variance of -$221k in the cost account 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2 (CMU).  The variance is from the assembly and testing of the first 240 modules and the associated cleanroom consumables.

This variance is expected due to missing input parts: hexaboards and baseplates. 
At CMU, we have ~40 baseplates and hexaboards and have begun assembly. We have made 16  modules.  We still do have the final tooling (Si pickup tools and trays), so module construction is proceeding at a rate of 2/day. This cadence will continue until we exhaust the inventory.  The final tooling is expected in mid March and more hexaboards are expected to start arriving in April.  The production of these first modules has been especially valuable for onboarding new technicians (Two new people started in February.) .

# Impact
The activities contributing to the cumulative SV is due to upstream delay of input parts and will be completed later than scheduled.  When the input parts become available the value will be earned and it should not impact the overall schedule.


# 402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB

- -458k 
	- 373k + 10
		-  -216k + -27k + 5 8 %
		- -115k + -15k + 5 16%
	- -38k
		- Cleanroom consubalbes 
	- -10 k 
		- Shipping
	- -37k
		- Support


There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$458k in the cost account 
402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB.  The variance has two pieces:
1) -421k Assembly, testing and shipping of full-size equivalent odd-sized modules 1-16%
2) - 37k for supporting production at other assembly site

This variance is expected due to missing input parts: hexaboards and baseplates. 

It is expected that UCSB will start the assembly of modules once parts will become available.
The will start with 12 HD full 120um Ti.

In the mean time, the ordering of the final assembly tooling is complete; the second batch of tools have been checked out and will be shipped to CMU and TTU shortly. The remaining orders are expected by the end of February. UCSB has been continuing tests on the irradiated modules with Ti baseplate

# 402.04.04.02 CE - Module Factories

## Cumulative

- -339k
	- -140
		- -80: Delivery of production module teststands
		- -60: HV and Dry air
	- -100 Final module tooling
	- -45: shipping cases / thermal testing unit
	- -45 test stands 
	- -10: Travel 


There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$339k in the cost account 
402.04.04.02 CE - Module Factories  The variance has three pieces:
- - 220k for delivery of production test stands and associated infrastructure 
- -100k for support and delivery of final module tooling
- -20k for purchase of shipping cases

This is a result of delays in the thermal unit design and delivery of testing electronics. The current estimate is that the testing electronics will be shipped in a few weeks to CMU, TTU and UCSB in time for the MAC ramp-up. A decision on the shipping crates has been made an purchases have started.  The procurement of the final tooling is well under way and much of this value should be earned next  month.  The test infrastructure will also be ordered shortly, once the statement of work is available at CMU. 

## Current

- -145k
	- -85k 402.44.501412 CE-Silicon Modules Factory FNAL M&S MIE-C  procurement of the final module factory tooling
	- - 60k 402.44.201392 Silicon Module Teststands MIE UNIV M&S: procurement of infrastruture needed for the final module teststands 

There is a current schedule variance of -$145k in the cost account 
402.04.04.02 CE - Module Factories  The variance has two pieces:
- - 85k for procurement and oversight of the final module factory tooling
- -60k procurement of infrastructure needed for the final module test stands
