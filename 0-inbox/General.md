-)  Innovation comes from putting well known ideas together; the growth is geometrical not linear.
    The more you know the more combinations you have of putting things together.

-) From Jaron Lanier "How the internet failed and how to recreate it"

   -) Idea of wolf pack vs loan wolf.  Some animals (including humans) have two modes of operation, alone and in social groups.
      When you are in "lone wolf mode" objective reality critical, when in "wolf pack mode" social hierarchy much more important.
      Wolf paack mode tends to lose touch with objective reality.

   -) Roughly speaking there are "bad" emotions: hate/fear/jealousy/insecurity etc and "good" emotion love/security/hope/calm/confidence etc.
      The time profiles of these are very different, "bad' emotions kick in quickly and have a long lifetime. 
      "Good" emotions take a while to build, but can abruptly collapse. Algorithms meant to capture our attention, are trained to have us engage. 
      Much easier for these engagement algoithms to see the signal for the "bad" emotions because they come on suddenly than the good emotions which gradually build up.
      Social media algorithms with thus be much more likely to use the "bad" emotions levers to increase engagement than the good emotions.

  -) Climate change not an existential threat. 

  -) Sea rise is annoying, but not transformational (except for low lying cities)

  -) Climate change will probably not be a big effect for people living in the first world. 
     have already gotten about 25% of the global warming we are likely to see by 2100

  -) Your parents had you despite the existential serious risk of nuclear war. 

  -) Now, in the 1st world is by far the best time to live in
   history. If you think you should have kids b/c thier quality of
   life wont be as good, this implies that you dont think anyone in
   the third world should have children

  -) Not many people are likely to not have children from climate change, maybe 5% max.
  Likely to have a bigger effect on national politics than on carbon emission. 
  
  -) the children of parents not concerned about climate change will
   be less likely themselves to be concerned with climate change.

  -) Could also just have kids and pay a carbon offset.
    


- "Machine Learning Fallacy"
   Learning an exotic skill is not the fast track to sucess.
   Much better to cultivate: 1) learn to be reliable 2) produce what you say you will at a high level
   These skills get you noticed and will lead to new bigger oppurtunities and the learning of fancy new skills.

- Most people are bad at giving advice based on thier experience.
  Instead ask them to tell you "thier story"
