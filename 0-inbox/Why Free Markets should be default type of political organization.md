- Why free markets? MAKE THIS A NOTE!!
	- No completely free markets, but all the rich countries have had something like a free market for a long time
	- There have been several instances of completely unfree markets (socialism) has been tried and it is clear that it leads to utter failure
	- No indication that having too much freedom is a problem (Is this really true ? Why are )
	- US doing better than Europe (economy and immigration destination) b/c freer system

- There are not free markets, but all rich countries have a history of almost-free-market
- In contrast, there have been full socialisist countries, they have all been abject disasters.
- There is no sign that the freest economies have "gone to far", From what we can see the freer the better.
- US is attached for having the smaller gov. than Europe, but immigrates prefer the US
- Free-market Monopolies are rare, and exist b/c they are the best at serving their customers. They quickly stop being monopolies, when they are not the best at serviing their customers
- B/c people will pay huge upcharge for density means the total development package is highly positive.
- Illegal immigrants are hired even though they are one of the least-liked groups in the country. This shows that employers are willing to put prejudice aside to hire the best person for the job. Once this sinks in, its clear that the real discrimination is the government required discrimanation against whites Asians and males.
