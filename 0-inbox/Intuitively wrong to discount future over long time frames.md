Discounting the future is counter intuitive and unethical over long time horizons. 

eg: At a "standard" 5% future discounting rate,
- one death today is worth 30 billion deaths in 500 years.  
- one death in 200 years is worth 100 deaths in 300 years


# Follow-ups
- It OK to discount for risk, but not simply the passage of time. Future benefits that are uncertain are not worth as much as those that are.
- [[Humans innate bias for the present over the future]]
