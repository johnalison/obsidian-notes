Dear Colleagues, 

Here is the institutional review from the CMU team.  
We found the paper very clear and well written, congratulations!
We only a few minor and comments/suggestions.

Type B

l151 says that you require exactly three isolated leptons.
However in l156 says "In case two or more OSSF lepton pairs"
How can you have more than 2 OSSF if you veto 3 leptons ?

Fig3 suggest to make these plots with same scale on x-axis 
(Was initially confused why the electron resolution seems so much worse, but think that it is mainly b/c the scale is different)

Table 2, why does the ISR uncertainty only affect the WZ. Should this also apply to the other backgrounds taken from MC ? 

Table 3: what cross section is assumed for the WZ here ?
