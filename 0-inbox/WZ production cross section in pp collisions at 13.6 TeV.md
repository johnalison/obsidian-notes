# Questions:

- l156: Can you have 2 OSSF if you veto 3 leptons.
	 "In case two or more OSSF lepton pairs"

- 217. The purity of ZZ in the ZZ CR is about 98% of the total yield,??
- fig3 suggest to make these plots with same scale on x-axis 
- Table 2, why does the ISR uncertainty only affect the WZ ? 
- Table 3: what cross section is assumed for the WZ here ?
- 250. is is 30%
