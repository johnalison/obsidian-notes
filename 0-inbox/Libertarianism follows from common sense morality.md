Libertarianism follows from simple principles
- **Its wrong to coerce people** (outside of very few specific cases with very good reasons)
	(eg: lifeboat taking on water) 
- **The government is coercive**. Laws are ultimately enforced by violence
- **The government doesn't have special permission to coerce**  (Lack of political authority)
