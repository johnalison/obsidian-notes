 looking for c(m, b) basically the only thing it can be subject to depending only on the current state of the particle. ie: being local in space (not dependent on properties of other particle) and time (not dependent on the future state of the particle)

QM provides a deep reason for there to be classically conserved quantities

- Dual descriptions: inside vs boundaries... will focus here on the boundaries
