Micheal Heumer

Outstanding ! Completely changed my mind about Governments. Basically accept his thesis. 

Thinking about the [[Importance Political Authority]], Heumer shows that our common sense moral intuitions imply that most of what governments do is unethical. "Political authority is incompatible with common sense moral beliefs"


Its not surprising that we have strong intuition that government actions are moral because
[[Intuitions on authority cannot be trusted]]. Governments would seem legitimate even if they were not.

**Definition of [[Libertarianism]]**- the government should do no more than protect the rights of individuals.

An argument for [[Libertarianism follows from common sense morality]]

He then makes an argument anarchism can work.  (Note: anarchism - the idea of a society without government -- needs a better brand name!)

"John Rawls is, by far and without question, the most influential political philosopher in the last 100 years"
