Micheal Heumer

Outstanding ! Completely changed my mind about Governments. Basically accept his thesis. 

Thinking about the [[Importance Political Authority]], Heumer shows that our common sense moral intuitions imply that most of what governments do is unethical.
"Political authority is incompatible with common sense moral beliefs"

"John Rawls is, by far and without question, the most influential political philosopher in the last 100 years"

Premises: 
- Its wrong to coerce people without very good reasons
	(ie: the benefit outweighs the costs and coersion is likely to be effective)

He then makes an argument anarchism can work.  (Note: anarchism - the idea of a society without government -- needs a better brand name!)
