Micheal Heumer

Outstanding ! Completely changed my mind about Governments. Basically accept his thesis. 

Thinking about the [[Importance Political Authority]], Heumer shows that our common sense moral intuitions imply that most of what governments do is unethical.
"Political authority is incompatible with common sense moral beliefs"

Premises: 
- Its wrong to coerce people without very good reasons
	(ie: the benefit outweighs the costs and coersion is likely to be effective)

He then makes an argument anarchism can work.  (Note: anarchism - the idea of a society without government -- needs a better brand name!)

Can see governments as limit of anarchic systems with runaway vertical + horizontal monopolies.  The reasoning against monopolies in the private sector, applies to the government in general.
