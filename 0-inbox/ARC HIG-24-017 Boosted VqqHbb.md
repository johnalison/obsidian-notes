# AN Review
http://cms.cern.ch/iCMS/jsp/openfile.jsp?tp=draft&files=AN2022_031_v9.pdf

- General:  Shoudl compare sensitivites to VBF and other leptonic decay modes

Section 2
- How are the HLT b-tagging SF calculated ? 
- l124: Why is the efficiency of the HLT that cuts on btagging so flat offline double b?  
- 133 Â As there are no flavor selections on the majority of the HLT paths, the efficiency on QCD jets. What about the HLT selections that have a flavor dependence ?

Section 3.3
- ETa requirement on Ak4 jets ?

Section 4:
- Ak4 jet veto: - ak4 < 5 looks tight (30 eta < 5) pT outside of the tracker? Signal eff loss form this cut ? What large uncertianty from modeling additial radation PU ?
	- Would think the Xbb cut would kill ttbar
- Really a bin boundry at 201 GeV ?!?  Why ?
- 

Section 5.1
- At least one AK4 jet satisfying the medium W.P. for deepJet b-tagging algorithm with and outside of the AK8 jet. Isnt this requiring 3 bs.  The CR really corrects for the a mistag in the AK8(bb) jet.  For the ttbar background, how often are the two bs clustered in the AK8 jet vs bkg from an AK8-bb mistag?

Section 5.3:
-  fitting to the rho? distribution in QCD Monte Carlo
- These QCD386 MC transfer factors are treated as uncorrelated across data taking periods. Why?
- 
# Pre-Approval:
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1451204/#17-pre-approval-of-hig-24-017
- More VH in the boosted regime
- Measured in ATLAS, not CMS.  VBF excess
- MeT < 140

Questions:
- OK: UL / Cert files not UL ?!?
- ak4 < 5 looks tight (30 eta < 5) pT outside of the tracker? Signal eff loss form this cut ?
- Why no PQCD on jet 1 ?
- How do you deal with the uncertainties on the fitting coeeficienents ? s20 
- TF_data what do these fits look like ? 
- s25 early late 2016 really mean pre and post ?
