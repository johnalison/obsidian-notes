 Â it is interesting that FSR is so important. We have double checked our implementation with the CMS twikis and the Run3 HH group. (Suggests that maybe we can gain by recovering FSR by re-clustering soft jets... something for the next iteration! )

FSR Big impact / ISR not a big deal

SvB and SvB_MA

# Plan for undergrad
- [ ] Give him signal files with paired b-jets and all unclustered jets.
- [ ] Make mass resolution plots 
- [ ] Try reclustering
