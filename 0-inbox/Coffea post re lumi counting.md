Dear experts, 

  Nubie question: Are there any tools/examples of checking that a coffea job processed all the expected data? 

  eg: 
   - Something that compares the lumi sections processed to those expected from the golden json ?  
   - Are there any tools/examples that checks for duplicate events (esp when running many jobs in DASK)

Thanks!
john
