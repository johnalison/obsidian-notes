### What is the change about? Include any details about the change

This change has two pieces which affect module production at the 3 US sites (CMU, TTU, and UCSB). 

The first is a change of the cost of consumables used during module production stemming from the change in adhesive used for module assembly and including an annual calibration of the OGP microscope used in the QA/QC process.

The OGP calibration will increase the cost by $2k.

The per module consumables cost will:
- increase by $8.75 (cost of the transfer tape) 
- decrease by $0.7 (we now need will need less of the Araldite epoxy)

The combined effect is an increase in the total cleanroom consumables cost of $24k at each site.  

The second change is for equipment needed to supply dry air and high-voltage for the multi-module test stand. This increases the cost of the setup needed per MAC by:
- $15k for high-voltage power supplies
- $5k for the dry-air regenerative air dryer





### Impact / Justification

The baseline assumed epoxy-only construction. However because some layers can arrive too warped to laminate with epoxy alone, would like to move to a "hybrid" adhesive strategy, using a combination of epoxy and transfer tape. 

Quality, specs, production rates, all at risk

about because of the change from epoxy only 

- ADHESIVES FOR MODULE STACKUP
- “Hybrid” adhesive method of lamination
- Because layers are not always flat: – Transfer tape was recommended

13 modules / cartrige 

. The specs for this dry air are more stringent than what  
we're using for our dry air storage cabinets, so at least at UCSB our  
current air dryer won't work for the MMTS.x

MACs will be responsible for the equipment needed to supply the dry air  
for the MMTS. T

# Notes


- Update all cleanroom consumable numbers ?
- Araldite:   464 -> 202  $20 -> $25
	- Current: 251 days * 24 modules / day * (13 modules / cartrige )^-1 = 464 x $20 = $9,280.00. (Was 20/13... now 25/30
	- New: 251 days * 24 modules / day * (30 modules / cartrige )^-1 = 201 cartridges x  $25 / cartrige = $4,020.00

* Transfer Tape: 251 * 24 m/d * 1 tape/module = 6024 * $8.75 = **$52710.0**
- OR: 251 * 12m/d = 3012 * $8.75 = **$26355.0**

Added OGP calibration

- -5k  + 26k + 1500 * 1.5 
45,344 + 2
$48288 -> $72,288 

$45344 -> 69344
$48396 + 24


# Assembly Estimates
Was: 34k / year  x 1./12 months x (1 month / 231 modules) = $12.27 / module
Now  56k /year  x  1/12 x 1/231 = $20.20 / module

# Questions:
- BOE assumes 24 modules glued /day x 251 days = 6024 ?
	- if 12/day = 3012 (/year) 
- How the uncertainty assessed ?

# BCR Draft 
- Cost update for transfer tape assembly  for ODMB5/7 boards



- How expensive is the Alerdite ? How much do we save now that we do transfer tape  ... mail to Jessica
- How much is the transfer tape ?  ... mail to Jessica
- Notes: 
	- $30/cartridge 
	- With full epoxy can do ~10 modules / cartridge  ~ $3 / module
    - Hybrid can do ~30 modules / catrige ~ $1 / module
    - Susanna:  (SRP) quote 9000 pieces, enough for 4500 modules each at TTU and CMU. The cost per item does come down to $8.75 with such a large quantity.
