- How much is the transfer tape ?  ... mail to Jessica
- Notes: 
	- $30/cartridge 
	- With full epoxy can do ~10 modules / cartridge  ~ $3 / module
    - Hybrid can do ~30 modules / catrige ~ $1 / module
    - Susanna:  (SRP) quote 9000 pieces, enough for 4500 modules each at TTU and CMU. The cost per item does come down to $8.75 with such a large quantity.
