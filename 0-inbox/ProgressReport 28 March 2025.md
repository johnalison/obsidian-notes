Habits have all been good. As usual, I could use some more mindfulness. Ive been doing some more Zettlekasten and good reading. I have been working more in the past couple weeks and have been doing a lot of social activities: Penguins games, Sara Shook concert, Bernie Klus funeral, and happy hours.

On the 4b side, I think I finally have a good first pass with the Run-3 synthetic dataset. I debugged the jet calibration and cutflow with Marina and we are now in agreement. I then made 16 synthetic dataset and passed it to her.  These look reasonable.  I want to determine the impact of the correlation on the final SvB variable. I think I understand how to do this using fluctuated event weights. After this, it might be a good time to present in Hbb again. 

We have also been doing some work on the latest (and should be last) round of L2 comments. These required making ROC plots and setting up at TTbar CR to make sure we are seeing the consistent data/MC yields.  We sent a mail with answers and cut a new AN. I think our next step is ARC review. 

Ive been doing lots of HGC work in the last two weeks. I redid the "estimate-to-complete" for module production using more realistic production procedures: the hybrid adhesive should allow 16 modules to be produced per day. I have also started to better understand the monthly budgets and how much we really have to spend. We will move forward on offering James Picard a tech/machinist position. Hopefully this will turn into something that can be supported by the department/college.  We recently started producing our first v3c modules. 

Wes gave the SoS approval talk; it went well. There were some questions, but the analysis is approved and will be shown at Moriond QCD! I've been iterating with Wes on his FNAL job talk slides. Its in a good state, but needs some work. He has moved back to the stats and will give a practice talk.
