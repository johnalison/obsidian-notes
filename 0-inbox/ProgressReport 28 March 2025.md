Lots of work on HGC lately. Lots of work to redo the "estimate-to-complete" for module production using more realistic production protocol: hybrid adhesive and 16 modules per day. I have also started to better understand the monthly budgets and how much we really have to spend. We will move forward on offering James Picard a tech/machinist position. Hopfully this will turn into something that can be supported by the department/college. 

Wes gave the SoS approval talk. It went well. There were some questions, but the analysis should be approved for Moriond QCD. I've been iterating with Wes on his FNAL job talk slides. Its in a good state, but needs some work. He has moved back to the stats and will give a practice talk.
