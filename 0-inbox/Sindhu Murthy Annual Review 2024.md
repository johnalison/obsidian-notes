Waiting on Sindhu...

# Summary of research plan and recommendations of committee:

The committee was very impressed with the progress Sindhu has made, particularly with the HGC upgrade project.  She has defined and executed projects to completion on her on initiative. This has required creativity and perspective. In this domain she is already operating at the level of a postdoc. However more work is needed on defining the physics analysis that the thesis will be based on and understanding how it fits into the bigger picture. 

The committee recommends that Sindhu shift emphasis away from the HGC upgrade project to the 4b analysis for her dissertation. She should work with her advisor to define a baseline plan for graduation, target date and analysis scope. This should naturally lead her to become familiar with the details of the analysis and the broader context.
