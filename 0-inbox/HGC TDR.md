Highest dose: 
- 2 MGy
- SiPMs get 3 kGy

- In order to keep the radiation-induced energy equivalent of electronics noise sufficiently low, SiPMs also have to be operated at around −30 ◦C. Hence the whole calorimeter will be operated at −30 ◦C. Will be cooled with two-phase C02.
- Thin SI active layers 100-300 µm. 300, 200, and 120 µm, in regions of increasing fluence
- EM 28 layers a depth of approximately 26 X0 and 1.7 λ
	- 14 layers of these (60') cassettes  provide the full 28 sampling layers.
- The absorber in the hadronic compartment consists of 12 planes of 35 mm thick SS plates followed by another 12 SS planes with a thickness of 68 mm
	- Between these absorber plates sit silicon modules and scintillator tileboards mounted on 6 mm thick copper cooling plates to form 30 ◦ wide cassettes. 
- total calorimeter thickness, perpendicular to the layers, of 10.7 λ, including the CE-E and the neutron moderator layer in front of the calorimeter

# Sensors

Thin: 
The sensor leakage current increases linearly with fluence, resulting in increased noise and, combined with the very high bias voltages, leads to substantial power dissipation within the sensors themselves. These ob- servations motivated the investigation of sensors thinner than the 300 μm typically used so far,

Fleunce is dominated by neutrons

Ncells / Wafer = 3 (diamonds) x 4 (rows) x 4 (cols) x 4 (cells) = 192 (LD).   (Cell Area 1.18 cm2)
              3 (diamonds) x 4 (rows) x 4 (cols) x 9 (cells) = 432 (LD).   (Cell Area 0.52 cm2)
               (But they have the same number of trigger inputs)

200 and 300 µm are LD
120 is the HD

Two cells per readout chip are segmented to include calibration pads with smaller size and correspondingly lower capacitance and noise.
