Highest dose: 
- 2 MGy
- SiPMs get 3 kGy

- In order to keep the radiation-induced energy equivalent of electronics noise sufficiently low, SiPMs also have to be operated at around −30 ◦C. Hence the whole calorimeter will be operated at −30 ◦C. Will be cooled with two-phase C02.
- Thin SI active layers 100-300 µm. 300, 200, and 120 µm, in regions of increasing fluence
- EM 28 layers a depth of approximately 26 X0 and 1.7 λ
	- 14 layers of these (60') cassettes  provide the full 28 sampling layers.
- The absorber in the hadronic compartment consists of 12 planes of 35 mm thick SS plates followed by another 12 SS planes with a thickness of 68 mm
	- Between these absorber plates sit silicon modules and scintillator tileboards mounted on 6 mm thick copper cooling plates to form 30 ◦ wide cassettes. 
- total calorimeter thickness, perpendicular to the layers, of 10.7 λ, including the CE-E and the neutron moderator layer in front of the calorimeter
