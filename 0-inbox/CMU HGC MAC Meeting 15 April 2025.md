- [ ] Follow up with FMS re:humidity (Jeff Harris)
- [ ] Order transfer tape ... 
- [ ] I just wanted to urge all of you to test your Juloabo chillers as soon as you are able to.  During the initial tests at TTU, Vladimir found out that our chiller needed repairs despite being brand new.  So, we are sending it back after consulting with Julabo.  Luckily we still had the shipping crate.  So, please test it and make sure it works properly.  Vladimir can give you more info if you need it.
