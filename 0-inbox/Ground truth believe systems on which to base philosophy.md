Philosophy needs some axioms to proceed. 

Several different plausible belief systems on which to base philosophy 
- "common sense" intuitions of the first-person self. ([[Knowledge, Reality, and Value]])
- state-of-the-art scientific worldview 
- state-of-the-art scientific worldview + many worlds 
- the non-dual awareness : (supported by lack of theory of personal identity) 
- pragmatic approach (see what works) [[The problems of philosophy]]

Should investigate the implications of each belief system [[MetaPhilosophy]]
# Follow-ups
- What is the world view supported by each 
- On which issues is there agreement, 
- Where is there disagreement 
- What can learn from the disagreements  ?
