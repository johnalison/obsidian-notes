Great book. Short and sweet.  I think this is fundamentally the "right" answer to ethics and political science. 

Overall framework set by ideals of **Prosperity and Liberty**. "Libertarianism Ã— Economics"
(Note not advocating pure libertarianism:  [[Libertarianism Limits]])

[[Sustainable Growth is a Moral Imperative]] 
- We have a moral imperative to lift people out of poverty (which tends to save their lives)
- [[Long-term economic growth is biggest factor in lifting people out of poverty]]. 
- Therefore, we have a moral imperative to take personal actions or pursue political policies that promote sustainable growth.
- In the long run, benefits from increasing rate of growth will dwarf those from all other actions
- And its [[Intuitively wrong to discount future over long time frames]] 

**Corollaries**
- Civilizational collapse is the worst thing that can happen.  Extra care should taken to avoid it.
- Imperative to avoid tragedies of the commons: environmental collapse / societal collapse

**Caveats**: 
- There are need to be basic guard rails on our actions to prevent the violation of basic liberties of individuals 

This Framework cuts across political lines. Following questions are critical under this system
	- How to boost economic growth (conservative)
	- How to make civilization more stable (conservative)
	- How avoid environmental collapse (liberal)
