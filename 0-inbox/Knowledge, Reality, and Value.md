Great!  Entertaining and Educational. Reminds me of [[Everything and More]]
Very good general introduction to Philosophy. 

Focuses on the implications of the "common sense" intuitions of the first-person self. 

[[Ground truth believe systems on which to base philosophy]]

[[Determining truth of assumptions makes philosophy is hard]]

[[Radical skepticism is a means of probing intuitions]]

[[Progress in Philosophy]]

To "begs the question" means to makes a circular argument. 
[[Advice]] : Don't use the phrase "begs the question"

[[Benefit of Philosophy to Other Disciplines]]

[[Treat opposition views seriously]]

# Score Card
- Truth Relativism is to be hated: it actively discourages the pursuit of truth
- External-world skepticism wrong: cannot account for the coherent reality we experience. 
- Global skepticism (skepticism about all knowledge) is obviously false.
- The concept of knowledge cant be rigorously defined (most concepts outside of technical term cant be)
-
