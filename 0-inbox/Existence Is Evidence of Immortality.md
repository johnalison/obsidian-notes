Notes:
- I shall argue (i) that your present existence constitutes significant evidence that you will be reincarnated, and (ii) that if the history of the universe is infinite, then you will be reincarnated.

- A sufficiently precise repetition of the right conditions will qualify as literally creating another incarnation of you.... You get this with an infinite universe..
