Great book!  New recommendation for new parents! Another new favorite author!

- Im a professor by trade, but the blogosphere is my intellectual home. Academic writing feels too narrow and timid. Blogs are the New World of the mind

- Many people are relucant to have more children because we think the pain outweighs the gain. 

- The claim of this book is that current and prospective parents have accidentally tipped their scales against fertility. 

   Parents are much more worried than they ought to be. Kids are much safer today then they were in the "Idyllic Fifties"
   
   Many of the benefits of children come later in life. Kids have high start-up costs, but wise parents weeigh those against a lifetime of rewards.
   
   
- Careful measurement confirms that parental effort is at an all-time high.

- Odds are you kids will painlessly inherit your brains, success, charm and modesty. 

- Children cost far less than most parents pay. 

- Our main challenge isnt kipping our kids safe, but appreciating how safe they really are. 

- Parenting is stressful, but much of the stress is unnecessary.

- Married couples with big families are much happier than childless singles. 
  Studies show that child care is a form or work, but its nice work if you can get it.
  
- Parents use a lot less discipline than they would if they counted their own interests.

- Disciplane needs: Clarity, Consistency, and Consequences
  Disciplane is like dieting : It works when tried

- If you can sharply improve your quality of life by midly punishing you kids, do so without apology. 
  If cruelty is the price of slightly better behaviour, dont buy. 
  
- Driving your third-grader to the store is vastly more dangerious than leaving him alone without a bodyguard. 

- There is absolutely nothing wrong with paying your children cash.  You're not trying to raise a communist. 

- Parents should be mature enough to protect their kids from secondhand stress.
