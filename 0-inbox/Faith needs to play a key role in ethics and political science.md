The quality of life in the far future is of critical importance ([[Stubborn Attachments]]). To do the right thing in the near term, we need to passionately believe in the long-term benefits despite that fact that we will never see them.  There two ways to get there, faith and abstract reasoning about the far future. Because [[Humans innate bias for the present over the future]] its hard for most people to reason clearly about very long time scales.  Faith, on the other hand, is the psychological technology that we have developed to get most people to deeply care about something they will never see.  It is a necessary tool to get us to make the very best decisions.
