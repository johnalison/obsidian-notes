Dear Colleagues  

I am writing to strongly support Wesley Terrill's application for the Lederman fellow. I have rarely encountered someone as independent and determined as Wes. He has forged his own path in both analysis and hardware projects—something that is exceptionally rare for a graduate student. He has the ability to identify compelling research directions, design and execute technically challenging analyses, and contribute meaningfully to hardware development.  This demonstrates a level of initiative and intellectual depth that makes him an outstanding candidate for this position. He also has an ambitious plan for developing a high school teacher training program, which is well-aligned with the goal of the Lederman fellowship.  

### **Innovative Approach to Analysis**


Wes is deeply interested in searching for dark matter. When he approached me about working in my group, we were not involved in dark matter searches; we had a cluster of closely related analyses looking for HH->4b.  I agreed to take Wes on with a qualification task related to b-tagging, figuring I would, with time, persuade him to join ongoing 4b effort.   Specifically, he was tasked with developing software to monitor the CMS b-jet trigger, which involved modifying existing code to analyze new b-tagging algorithms introduced in the LHC Run-3. Additionally, he developed an algorithm that increased the b-jet purity of the monitored jets by effectively performing a real-time top-quark analysis. His work was highly valued by the b-tagging group. 


After completing the b-tagging project, I again tried to convince him to join the 4b effort, instead he ended up convincing me to branch out into searches for dark matter. He proposed looking for dark matter models with compressed spectra; my initial reaction was skepticism — I had not been following this corner of the field closely but assumed that meaningful sensitivity gains beyond the legacy Run-2 limits would only come with High-Luminosity LHC data. He pointed out that because the analysis -- with the extremely small splittings he was interested in -- was so difficult there actually weren't any meaningful Run-2 limits. My second reaction was that OK he had succeeded in constructing a clever dodge to avoid the previous limits, but that the resulting analysis would only be sensitive to a niche signal without wider context. He came back and made a compelling case that this search was both important and broadly applicable beyond the specific compressed dark matter scenario, as nearly degenerate spectra are a general feature many models of new physics.  He further demonstrated that presence of soft leptons (if you could understand the efficiency and control the fakes!) would suppress the dominant Z→νν "monojet" background, making the search more viable than I had initially anticipated. 

I then agreed to support Wes in the dark matter search, pointing out to him that he would not have the usual postdoc and senior grad student support typical for members of my group. He contacted and ultimately joined a team in the CMS SUSY group. Wes, working closely with Christian Herwig (FNAL, now Michigan),  would focus on the electron channel and Peter Meiring  (Zurich, now CMU) would focus on the muon channel.  

Wes' analysis is hard! His thesis is effectively three analyses in one: di-lepton, tri-leptons and displaced leptons. Identifying and modeling electrons down to 1 GeV required him to develop:
- dedicated lepton identification optimization, esp: pile-up suppression
- new technique for calibrating the reconstruction and identification of displaced electrons based on photon conversions in the detector material
- dedicated and precise measurements of the low pT fake backgrounds, which had to account for correlation of the fake rate in nearby leptons  
In the end, Wes was able to control the leptons to 1 GeV and indeed the analysis is sensitive to new , beyond the previouds limits from LEP. The analysis is currently going to the statarnd CMS approval process, with the approval talk, to be given by Wes, expected next month. The non-displaced channels have already been approved as part of a Phd thesis. 

### **Contributions to HGCAL Hardware Development**

Beyond his work on analysis, Wes was eager to get involved in hardware, specifically in the development and testing of the CMS High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL). Given that our institution has Module Assembly Center (MAC), this was a natural fit. However, he also wanted to be based at CERN, leading to a creative solution—he took on a key role in the CERN silicon lab, working with state-of-the-art testing hardware and protocols before they were propagated to the MACs. He became our "man in Havana," staying ahead of developments and ensuring that our testing methodologies were aligned with the latest advancements.

His work on HGCAL testing included critical contributions to cryogenic light injection and laser-based characterization, where he demonstrated the same technical depth and problem-solving ability that defined his analysis work. His experience in both hardware and analysis makes him uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between instrumentation and data analysis—an increasingly valuable skill set in experimental particle physics.

### **Conclusion**

[Candidate’s Name] has demonstrated the rare ability to drive his own research program from conception to execution. His intellectual independence, combined with his technical expertise in both analysis and hardware, makes him an outstanding candidate for a postdoctoral position. I am confident that he will make significant contributions to any research group he joins. I strongly recommend him without reservation and am happy to provide further insights if needed.

Sincerely,

Big picture: 
- Forged his own path on analysis and hardware project. 
	- Exteremly rare for a student


Analysis project:
- Interested in searching for dark matter.
- My initial reaction was that we need the HLLHC data for interesting sensitivyt gains.
- Wes pushed idea of compressed spectra: 
	- hard anaysis 
	- also means we havent been done yet
- Was initially reluctant worried it was too narrowly focused. 
- He convinced my the physics case was imporant, and broadly applicible.
- soft leptons handle to reduce Z->nn mono-jet background 

His Analysis Hard!
- 3 analyses in one
- low pt. fakes / PU
- After we started , again convinced me that this was worthwhile. 
- SF using conversions

Wanted to be involved in HGC hardware project 
- great b/c we have MAC on campus 
- also wanted to be based at CERN
- creative solution working in the CERN silicon lab. 
- our man in havanna : using latest testing hardware and protocols before propogated to the MACs

Outreach
- I know outreach is imporant for this position
- I know wes has some creative ideas for getting high-school teachers 
- I am happy to support him in this through my contacts at CMU

HGC testing light injection cryo, laser

Cassette ASsembly
- would be a good fit for cassette assembly 

I run Module assembly center, 
would gladly have Wes as leader

Letter

Wes has also starting working a search for dark matter models with compressed mass spectra using soft leptons.
The analysis targets models with several new particles with similar masses.
Compressed spectra is a common structure seen both in the standard model and as a part of many new physics scenarios.
This situation naturally arises when the overall mass of a particle multiplet is set by one scale and the splitting between states is set by a second, parametrically-larger scale. 
The detector signature Wes is searching for is large missing energy plus soft (low pT) leptons arising from cascade decays between particles within the multiplet. 
The lepton pT is set by the mass splitting between the states; low pT thresholds are thus critical to maximize acceptance to small mass splittings.
Building on a previous CMS analysis, Wes is lowering the electron pT threshold from 5 GeV down to 1 GeV. 
Reconstructing electrons in this pT range is not standard in CMS,  and Wes has had to modify nominal reconstruction algorithms and develop dedicated methods to calibrate these ultra-soft electrons.
