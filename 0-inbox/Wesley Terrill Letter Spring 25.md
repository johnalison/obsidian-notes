Dear Colleagues  

I am writing to strongly support Wesley Terrill's application for the Lederman fellow. I have rarely encountered someone as independent and determined as Wes. He has forged his own path in both analysis and hardware projects—something that is exceptionally rare for a graduate student. His ability to identify compelling research directions, design and execute technically challenging analyses, and contribute meaningfully to hardware development demonstrates a level of initiative and intellectual depth that makes him an outstanding candidate for this position. He has an ambitious plan for developing a high school teacher training program, which is well-aligned with the goal of the Lederman fellowship.  

### **Innovative Approach to Analysis**


Wes is deeply interested in searching for dark matter.
- When he approached me about working in my group, we were not doing ; we had a cluster of anlayses related to the search for HH->4b. 
- I agreed to take Wes on with a qualification task related to b-tagging, figuring I would, with time, persuade him to join ongoing 4b effort. 
- We did B-jet trigger, but 
- Instead he convinced me to branch out into searches for dark matter.

When he first proposed investigating compressed spectra, my initial reaction was skepticism—I believed that meaningful sensitivity gains beyond the legacy Run-2 limits would only come with High-Luminosity LHC data. However, he was persistent, arguing that while the analysis would be extremely challenging, the fact that it hadn’t been done yet made it a unique opportunity. He made a compelling case that such a search was both important and broadly applicable beyond the specific compressed dark matter scenario. He further demonstrated that soft leptons could be used to suppress the dominant Z→ννZ \to \nu\nuZ→νν monojet background, making the search more viable than I had initially anticipated.

His analysis work is exceptionally demanding, effectively three analyses in one. He tackled the difficulties associated with low-pTp_TpT​ fakes, pileup contamination, and the estimation of backgrounds using novel scale factor techniques derived from photon conversions. After we began the project, he once again convinced me of its worth, demonstrating not only his technical skill but also his ability to push forward an ambitious physics program despite the inherent difficulties.

### **Contributions to HGCAL Hardware Development**

Beyond his work on analysis, [Candidate’s Name] was eager to get involved in hardware, specifically in the development and testing of the CMS High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL). Given that our institution houses a Module Assembly Center (MAC), this was a natural fit. However, he also wanted to be based at CERN, leading to a creative solution—he took on a key role in the CERN silicon lab, working with state-of-the-art testing hardware and protocols before they were propagated to the MACs. He became our "man in Havana," staying ahead of developments and ensuring that our testing methodologies were aligned with the latest advancements.

His work on HGCAL testing included critical contributions to cryogenic light injection and laser-based characterization, where he demonstrated the same technical depth and problem-solving ability that defined his analysis work. His experience in both hardware and analysis makes him uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between instrumentation and data analysis—an increasingly valuable skill set in experimental particle physics.

### **Conclusion**

[Candidate’s Name] has demonstrated the rare ability to drive his own research program from conception to execution. His intellectual independence, combined with his technical expertise in both analysis and hardware, makes him an outstanding candidate for a postdoctoral position. I am confident that he will make significant contributions to any research group he joins. I strongly recommend him without reservation and am happy to provide further insights if needed.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]  
[Your Title]  
[Your Institution]

Big picture: 
- Forged his own path on analysis and hardware project. 
	- Exteremly rare for a student


Analysis project:
- Interested in searching for dark matter.
- My initial reaction was that we need the HLLHC data for interesting sensitivyt gains.
- Wes pushed idea of compressed spectra: 
	- hard anaysis 
	- also means we havent been done yet
- Was initially reluctant worried it was too narrowly focused. 
- He convinced my the physics case was imporant, and broadly applicible.
- soft leptons handle to reduce Z->nn mono-jet background 

His Analysis Hard!
- 3 analyses in one
- low pt. fakes / PU
- After we started , again convinced me that this was worthwhile. 
- SF using conversions

Wanted to be involved in HGC hardware project 
- great b/c we have MAC on campus 
- also wanted to be based at CERN
- creative solution working in the CERN silicon lab. 
- our man in havanna : using latest testing hardware and protocols before propogated to the MACs

Outreach
- I know outreach is imporant for this position
- I know wes has some creative ideas for getting high-school teachers 
- I am happy to support him in this through my contacts at CMU

HGC testing light injection cryo, laser

Cassette ASsembly
- would be a good fit for cassette assembly 

I run Module assembly center, 
would gladly have Wes as leader

Letter

Wes has also starting working a search for dark matter models with compressed mass spectra using soft leptons.
The analysis targets models with several new particles with similar masses.
Compressed spectra is a common structure seen both in the standard model and as a part of many new physics scenarios.
This situation naturally arises when the overall mass of a particle multiplet is set by one scale and the splitting between states is set by a second, parametrically-larger scale. 
The detector signature Wes is searching for is large missing energy plus soft (low pT) leptons arising from cascade decays between particles within the multiplet. 
The lepton pT is set by the mass splitting between the states; low pT thresholds are thus critical to maximize acceptance to small mass splittings.
Building on a previous CMS analysis, Wes is lowering the electron pT threshold from 5 GeV down to 1 GeV. 
Reconstructing electrons in this pT range is not standard in CMS,  and Wes has had to modify nominal reconstruction algorithms and develop dedicated methods to calibrate these ultra-soft electrons.
