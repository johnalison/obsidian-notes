Big picture: 
- Forged his own path on analysis and hardware project. 
	- Exteremly rare for a student


Analysis project:
- Interested in searching for dark matter.
- My initial reaction was that we need the HLLHC data for interesting sensitivyt gains.
- Wes pushed idea of compressed spectra: 
	- hard anaysis 
	- also means we havent been done yet
- Was initially reluctant worried it was too narrowly focused. 
- He convinced my the physics case was imporant, and broadly applicible.
- soft leptons handle to reduce Z->nn mono-jet background 

Analysis Hard
- 3 analyses in one
- low pt. fakes / PU
- After we started , again convinced me that this was worthwhile. 
- SF using conversions

Wanted to be involved in HGC hardware project 
- great b/c we have MAC on campus 
- also wanted to be based at CERN
- creative solution working in the CERN silicon lab. 
- our man in havanna : using latest testing hardware and protocols before propogated to the MACs

HGC testing light injection cryo, laser

Cassettes 

I run Module assembly center, 
would gladly have Wes as leader
