Three Variances:
- 402.04.04.02 CE - Module Factories
- 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2
- 402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB

# 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2

There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$240k in the cost account 
402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly at CMU.  The variance has two pieces:
- 1) -220k Variance from the Assembly of the 1st 240 modules.
- 2) -20k Variance from Updating procedures based on prototyping experience

This variance is expected due to missing input parts: hexaboards and baseplates. 

It is expected that CMU will start the assembly of modules once parts will become available.
