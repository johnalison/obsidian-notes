# 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2


Schedule Variance:

-227k
- - 208k 
	- 70k Assemble and test 1-80 
	- 140: 81-240
- 17k cleanroom consumables

There is a schedule variance of -$227k in the cost account 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2 (CMU).  The variance is from the assembly and testing of the first 240 modules and the associated cleanroom consumables.

This variance is expected due to missing input parts: hexaboards. 
At CMU, we now have 8 baseplates and 48 hexaboards and have begun assembly on the first 8 modules.  32 additional baseplate have been shipped to CMU. We still do have the final tooling, so module construction is proceeding at a rate of 2/day. This cadence will continue as baseplates become available.  In the new year, with the finalized tooling, we will increase the number of modules per day.

# Impact
The activities contributing to the cumulative SV is due to upstream delay of input parts and will be completed later than scheduled.  When the input parts become available the value will be earned and it should not impact the overall schedule.

# 402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB


- -446k
	- -373k production odd-sized 1-16%
	-  -40k: cleanroom consumables / shipping
	- - -32k: support of operations at all module sites


There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$446k in the cost account 
402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB.  The variance has two pieces:
1) -410k Assembly, testing and shipping of full-size equivalent odd-sized modules 1-16%
2) - 30k for supporting production at other assembly site

This variance is expected due to missing input parts: hexaboards and baseplates. 

It is expected that UCSB will start the assembly of modules once parts will become available.
The will start with 12 HD full 120um Ti.

In the mean time, the ordering of assembly tooling is well underway; the first batch of tools have been checked in shipped to CMU and TTU. The remaining orders have been placed. UCSB has also been following up on the recent site visits. This has allowed the US MACs to synchronize methods, share best practices, and plan the specifics of ramping-up.
