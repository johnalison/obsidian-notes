	l81: ECM: Test standard PCB batch 1 (First 5%) to 20%
	l157: ECM-Assemble and test module 1-80 at Site 2
	l158 ECM- Supervise assembly and testing of modules 1-80 at Site 2

- From Barney:
	- I strongly suggest you follow the P2UG presentations by HGCAL that happen 1-2 times per year, as this sort of thing is always mentioned. You can look at Paul's presentation at the November P2UG ([https://indico.cern.ch/event/1471927/contributions/6197528/attachments/2959391/5207889/HGCAL%20Electronics%20P2UG%205Nov24.pdf](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1471927/contributions/6197528/attachments/2959391/5207889/HGCAL%20Electronics%20P2UG%205Nov24.pdf)) for a reasonable summary of the status of the Hexaboards. 

- Since November:

	- about 1500 more LD Full Hexaboards received at CERN (bare). Visual inspection done on a sampling basis - all very good
	- 60 LD Full assembled with HGCROC3C before Christmas and tested recently: look good (with the provisos of 3C of course)
	- Orders placed with an assembly company (one we know well) for assembly of another ~900 boards - mostly Full, but also some partials - to get the MACs producing modules for the pre-series cassettes and to prove (again on a sampling basis) that the batches of PCBs are ok. These assemblies should all be done with 3C. 
	- Invitations to Tender for mass assembly will be launched at the end of this week, with mass assembly then due to start around April/May


## [[7 January 2025 Tuesday]]
- ### CAM Reporting
	- Moved baseplates to 15% (lines: 64 and 65)

		- Batch 1 = 240 modules/ 
		- [[Module assembly at CMU]]
	- Start 74 ECM:Vendor delivers assembled standard PCB batch 1 (First 5%)
		- HAve 48 hexaboards 
	- Start 78 ECM: Test standard PCB batch 1 (First 5%)
	- Start 81 ECM: Snhip PCB batch 1 to module assembly sites
	- Start 106? (Have Kria at CMU!)
	- Start 149 150 
	- close 116 / 123
