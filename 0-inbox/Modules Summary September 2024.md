UCSB is Wrapping up preseries
build 5 LD right for irradiation campaign
Glue/Encapsulation studies 
All the modules built with the new glue/tape pattern do not show noisy channels identified during assembling procedure 
Covering CM capacitor with encapsulate helps protecting chips against failures
 US MAC Assembly tooling order: Xometry 


CMU finished preseries
11 live modules assembled (eight assembled two at a time)
10/11 have good performance.  1 has low breakdown, investigations ongoing. 
Lots of studies characterizing the noise. Many noisy cells at the perimeter expect this will be mitigated with new glue/tape pattern from UCSB.
Lots of work on integrating database into module assembly workflow. 
Shipping material for 3 US MACs ordered. Delivery date TBD
Ad out for new lab tech. Will hire 2 end of year


Waiting for hexaboards hope for Nov.  Limit by ROC availability
