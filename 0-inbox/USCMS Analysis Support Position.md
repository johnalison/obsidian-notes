Requirements: 

We encourage U.S. CMS PIs who have suitable candidates in their group to please submit a letter of interest (2 pages maximum) with a description of qualifications of the candidate and an outline of a plan that addresses the task requirements.

- c++ -> coffea framework
- CIs 
- reAna
- L3 CAT position: - Workflow Orchestration and Analysis Preservation ([WFLOWS](https://cms-analysis.docs.cern.ch/wflows/))
	https://cms-analysis.docs.cern.ch/wflows/
	This subgroup has the responsibility for the support, management, and development of tools for the orchestration of physics analysis workflows, promoting tools that ease the long-term reproducibility of analyses.
- history of JET MET work

Plan: 
- data driven analyis (hh4b) complex MC (bbWW)
- work with JET MET.. then other object groups to profiles code 
- push CI: Snakemake

Analysis Support:

The U.S. CMS strategy for end-user analysis in the HL-LHC era depends heavily on new processing tools like RDataFrame and Coffea. These tools achieve processing rates that make it clear we can achieve near-interactive turn around for end-user analysis in the HL-LHC era, and so are critical to the success of the CMS experiment for the next decade. These tools bring with them a significant increase in user interface complexity, especially with respect to achieving best-possible performance, and often the patterns for doing so are not yet known in general. 

The task for this support role is to document and aid in developing effective analysis patterns, as well as to disseminate this information to the user bases of these tools. This should be done in close collaboration with the communities using these tools, to collect usage data and find patterns to synthesize, as well as the developer communities to understand long-term goals, design, and to match that with user needs. 

Emphasis should be placed upon developing effective design patterns and usage strategies but also identify areas of improvement for the tools, and not to only determine “workarounds” that solve immediate problems without considering long term plans and needs.



**Requirements:**  
  

- Understanding of the physics analysis development process in modern particle physics experiment
- Competency in the scientific python or RDataFrame analysis software stacks, and a willingness to learn both to in order to support users and find patterns
- Ability to develop tools that aid users will simultaneously considering long term support requirements
- Willingness to learn regression testing practices and to help maintain stably performing software releases
- Desirable but not required: basic knowledge of the computing trends and facilities roadmaps, to understand what analysis strategies will be supportable over many years

**Expected time on task:** 0.5 FTE total for one year, renewable
