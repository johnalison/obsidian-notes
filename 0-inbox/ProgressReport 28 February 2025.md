4b side. Steady progress
Fix to the synthetic data. 

Ive been working on the closure test with the Run2 synthetic dataset, making the Run 3 synthetic dataset, and answering the L2 comments.

 - The Run2 synthetic closure looks pretty good now, Im still seeing some large FvT weights. Not clear where they are coming from. Chuyan, can you point to me where the event selection is done for the FvT training code ?

 - The Run3 synthetic data looks good on our side, but Marina still sees big data vs syn-data differences. Im going to debug this with her.

 - The L2 comments are mostly done. We still need the 2D plots (ΔR vs mass / and nViews vs Mass) -- which I think AE is working on -- and the Acc X Eff pltos which I am working on. Seems like the trigger weights are not being applied in the cut flow currently, 

  - Id like to send a reply to the L2s soon. We should talk about when it makes the most sense to.

bbWW plan is to move to new coffea and Run3
