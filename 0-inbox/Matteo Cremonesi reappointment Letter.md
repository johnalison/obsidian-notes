Well recieived. Teaching I have heard from several students that his graduate particle course was very useful and 

Working on HGCal reconstruciton 

Searching for new physics on two fronts. 
	Direct search for dark matter, 
	Looking for devations in SM predictions

ZH very good idea

# Notes

- Computing leader
- chosen as new JDM convener 

Grad Particle course well received 

Focus expanded beyond Dark Matter to include Di-Higgs.
