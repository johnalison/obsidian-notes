Planted a lot of seeds

Wisely broadened scope of physics interested 
Modified physics to make a better fit with exisiting group.


Di-Higgs / jet performace 
While no CMS papers, couple in the oven

Well recieived. Teaching I have heard from several students that his graduate particle course was very useful and 

Working on HGCal reconstruciton 
Helping with The ECON Characterization Team (ECT

Searching for new physics on two fronts. 
	Direct search for dark matter, 
	Looking for devations in SM predictions

ZH very good idea

# Notes

- Computing leader
- chosen as new JDM convener 

Grad Particle course well received 

Focus expanded beyond Dark Matter to include Di-Higgs. 


## Follow-ups

Of the 48 TCs of each sen- sor, 3 of them are selected for most of the detector using the current baseline threshold ???
