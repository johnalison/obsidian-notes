Matteo is above the bar for a faculty reappointment. 
He is an leading expert in direct searches for dark matter at the LHC 
Since joining CMU, Matteo has broadened his scope to target other physics (Higgs and dibosom production) with closely-rated detector signatures.
He has been awarded highly sought-after leadership roles within the experiment.
He has also refocused his detector commissioning and algorithms development toward the High-Granulartiy calorimeter, a smart move given the existing strengths and expertise of the group. Matteo has planted a lot of seeds, if even a sub-set of them come into bloom he will be an superb faculty member.

di-Higgs
Di-Higgs / jet performace 


Jet leadership

detector development
Helping with The ECON Characterization Team (ECT


Wisely broadened scope of physics interested 
Modified physics to make a better fit with exisiting group.



Well recieived. Teaching I have heard from several students that his graduate particle course was very useful and 

Working on HGCal reconstruciton 

Searching for new physics on two fronts. 
	Direct search for dark matter, 
	Looking for devations in SM predictions

ZH very good idea

# Notes

- Computing leader
- chosen as new JDM convener 

Grad Particle course well received 

Focus expanded beyond Dark Matter to include Di-Higgs. 


## Follow-ups

Of the 48 TCs of each sen- sor, 3 of them are selected for most of the detector using the current baseline threshold ???
