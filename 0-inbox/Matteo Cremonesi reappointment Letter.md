Matteo is above the bar for a faculty reappointment.  He is a leading expert in direct searches for dark matter at the LHC.  Since joining CMU, Matteo has broadened his scope to target other compelling physics areas which have detector signatures closely-rated to those of the direct dark matter searches. His work has been recognized with funding and with highly sought-after leadership roles within the experiment. He has also refocused his work on detector commissioning and algorithm development toward the High-Granularity calorimeter; a smart move given the existing strengths and expertise of the group. Matteo has planted a lot of seeds, if even a sub-set of them come into bloom he will be an superb faculty member. 

Dark matter can be directly produced at the LHC, but it cannot be directly measured. Any Dark matter particles would pass through our detector without depositing any energy. Their presence can however be inferred from a momentum imbalance: a good indication that some non-interacting particle is carrying away momentum.  This "missing momentum" signature is a central part of the physics program at CMS; its used everywhere, from detailed measurements of known particles to searches for exotic potential signatures of physics beyond our current theory. Matteo is one of the collaboration's experts in measuring and calibrating missing momentum. He is currently convening the group in CMS that oversees the use of misssing momentum in all analyses.

So far, Matteo has been focused on applying his expertise in missing momentum to direct searches for dark matter. These searches target specific ideas for how the Dark matter may interact with the known particles. These searches are well-motivated, but narrowly focused.  They highly constrain certain models of new physics, but are of limited value outside a particularly hypothetical scenarios. 

Recently, Matteo has started applying the tools and techniques used in these dedicated dark matter searches to a much broader physics program. This will allow him to leverage his expertise in exicting areas beyond the dark matter community. Personally, I am very excited to work with Matteo on applying his knowledge to search di-Higgs search. This physics has broad implications and his expertise provides a new line of attack on this important problem.

Well recieived. Teaching I have heard from several students that his graduate particle course was very useful and 

Working on HGCal reconstruciton 

Searching for new physics on two fronts. 
	Direct search for dark matter, 
	Looking for devations in SM predictions

ZH very good idea

- Computing leader
- chosen as new JDM convener 

Grad Particle course well received 

Focus expanded beyond Dark Matter to include Di-Higgs. 


## Follow-ups

Of the 48 TCs of each sen- sor, 3 of them are selected for most of the detector using the current baseline threshold ???
