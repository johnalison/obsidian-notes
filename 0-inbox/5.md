How could you prove the world was determinsitic?

You could
 - explicity demonstrate it in simple subsytems. 
 - Show that the laws (theory) predict the outcome
 - Then assume that the theory applies to more complicated systems

Seems like you have to prove that a theory is deterministic and then claim that the theory applies to the world.


   - determism is the statement that initial conditions predict all future behaviour
