Did Panda on ATLAS

Accelerator: ~30B
Detectors ~10% Accelerator cost

Need computing ...
- Niave cost estimate: Drwarfs the estimate of Accelerators 
	- 2M CPU cores : 500M / year
	- data 1 Exabyte 300M
	- GPU: 150 
	- Total cost: 1B / year ~ 50B total

How can we afford the computing ?

Well, what are we doing now ?
	- Already using ~500k cores (ATLAS only)
	- 300 PB disk (1/3 of the way there)

Resource cost already today approaching 1B / year
