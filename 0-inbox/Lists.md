# Why Now is interesting

- Multi-Planetary Species
- AI revolutions
- Brain-Machine Interface 
- Longevity
- Ability to kill all of humanity (nukes / bio) 
- Genetic Re-engineering 
- Close to last generation that uses sex to reproduce
- The precipice:
  > Claim that we now possess the ability to destroy ourselves without the wisdom to avoid doing so.
  > => high probability this will happen. 
  > If we can avoid total destruction in next couple 100 years, we will have  the ability to "live forever" 
- Now the principles of Darwinian evolution are evolving. 
  > conception through sex disappearing
- We are living through a revolution: Information revolution. We have internalize it so dont think about it so much. With our current political situation: Could we be "paying the tab" for all the great 21st century tech? This information age revolution is different because a core principle is the perpetually accelerating innovation. Society does not have time to "catch up" with the new world order and adapt.
- The man of knowledge in our time has a burden he never imaged, the overproduction of truth that cannot be consumed. Use to believe that truth was slim and elusive and once we found it our troubles would be over. Now we are choking in truth. (Denial of Death)
- Scientific revolution may well end history and start somethign different (Reason that now is different) 
- These days every year is revolutionary. Today, even a thiry-year old can honestly tell disbelieving teenagers "When I was young, the was completely different"
- Ours is the first time in history that the world is dominated by a peace-loving elite - politicians, business people, intellectuals and artists which genuinely see war as both evil and avoidable.
- Homo sapiens are transcending biologically determined limits. It is now beginning to break the laws of natural selection, replacing them with the laws of intelligent design
- For the first time in history, more people die today from eating too much than from eating to little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined.

# Crazy things scientists used to believe
- Sperm is little homunculus
- Darwin wrote that emotional imbalance could cause fuzzy hair.
- Phrenology measure mental essences as bumps on the skull
- Infants prior to the 1980s where not anesthetized during major surgery, on belief that couldnt feel pain.
- Early plastics were designed to look like wood. 
- Not long ago psychologists doubted the importance of the emotional bond between parents and children even among humans. Childcare experts warned that children who were hugged and kissed by their parents would grow up to be needy, egotistical and insecure adults
- Scholars once claimed agricultural revolution as a great leap forward for humanity. Fantasy! No evidence people became more intelligent. AR => harder lives for those who lived through it.

# Things where experts disagree
Can tell where we don't really understand problems when experts wildly disagree. In these cases understand BOTH sides. Silly to pick one. 

- Interpretations of QM
- Fermi Paradox
- Future of AI / AGI
- Future of Brain-Machine-Interface
- Hierarchy Problem
- CC 
- Universe as Simulation
- Free will ? 
- Consensus 
- Cryonics



# Mental Models

- Bias Variance Trade off
- Lepton Fake Factor
- Closure Test
- Circle of Competencies
  > Understand/be aware of what you dont know and what you are not an expert it.
  > Probe to find where the limits of the "experts".
- First principles thinking
  > Exactly what physics trains for. 
  > Look for moving parts, knowns/unknowns and see how things fit together.  
  > Ignore the stories that you cant understand. 
  > Doubt everything that you cant get to from axioms.
- The map is not the territory
  > Understand the limits/inherent simplifications in the model.
  > Need different maps of the same territory to convey different relevant information.
  > Maps/models are tools, decisions should ultimately reflect the reality of the situation/territory.
  > Physics Examples: EFTs.
- Law of diminishing returns
  > Example of 80/20.
  > Get the low hanging fruit.
  > Acquire breath of knowledge at the 80/20 level. 
  > Then choose what long sloughs to fight. 
- 2nd order thinking
  > Consider the consequences of the consequences of your action.
  > Obviously want to think to as high an order as possible.
  > Developing trust is a great example (Be reliable ! See dont lie and be the good).
- Inversion 
  > "Invert, always invert" - Jacobi

  > Avoiding stupidity often easier than seeking brilliance

  > Index funds (Vanguard) can be seen as form on inversion
     > Easy to avoid poor returns 
     > Easy to lower known fees
     > Together these outperform almost everything

  > Inversion Steps: 
     > 1) Identify Problem, 
     > 2) Define Objective, 
     > 3) Identify forces that support change toward objective, 
     > 4) Identify forces that impede change toward objective, 
     > 5) Strategize. Add forces in 3) and remove from 4) 

  > Most people stop at 3), Inversion is all about finding problems that make things worse, and avoid doing them.

  > Ford bough scrapped Ford cars to find out wihch parts DIDNT fail.  Those could be made a lot cheaper. (Inversion) 

- Occams Razor (William of Ockham) 
- Hanlons Razor 
  > Most people doing wrong are not bad people trying to be malicious. 
  > Stupidity far more common than malice.

- Proving things about poly-nominals usual much easier than proving things about integers: Poly-Nominals have roots and can be differentiated. 
   (Is there a notion of differentiation that can be applied to integers? Primes? ) (Fearless Symmetry)

- Sturgeons Law: 90% of everything is crap. Look for the 10%.

- "Free roll" decisions with asymmetry between upside and downside b/c potential losses are insignificant.

- "Applause light" Saying something that is so trite that the reversal sounds abnormal, then the unreversed statement is not conveying new information.

- Basis for demcocarsy equal rights movement is religous not scientific

Builds expertise in debugging technical problems (motivates the building of a Linux machine). Example of compounding returns.

# Paradoxes                                                             

- Paradox of the Mind: When we look, mind seems totally insubstantial, yet everything we experience is a modification of the mind. 
- We spend most of our time trying to change What Is into What Should Be.  Turns out that this change is often easiest after we truly accept what is.
- We are identical with one of the greatest mysteries in the Universe. In a sense its the only thing we know, can know. In another, it is one of the last great unknowns (to science).
- Incompleteness Theorem:     "There is more to truth that provability in the deductive system" /     Arithmetic truth out runs formal provability / Truth values of undecidable statements can be decided by embedding them in a richer structure. Also common practice of mathematicians, eg: invoke structures far richer than a statement they are trying to prove. /   - No consistent theory can prove its own consistency /
- How can humans, physical organisms in a physical universe, have knowledge of a casually inert realm of abstract objects?
- Ever since the French revolution, people throughout the world have gradually come to see both equality and freedom as fundamental values. Yet the two values contradict each other.
- The more you examine your mind, the more you discover there is no fixed truth to who you are as a person. Your very efforts to improve your experince,  are generally what prevents you from understanding the depth and beauty of the most ordinary moments in life. To seek happiness in all the usual ways is to overlook it now. 
- Consequence of the Availability-misweighing tendency:
     - One consequence is that extra vivid evidence, being so memorable and thus more available in cognition, should often be underweighed while less vivid evidence should be over-weighed.

- Animals with rationality - the tool that may allow us to transcend our situation
- Optimism and hubris is built into our operating systems

- We are gods with anuses (Becker)
- The basic insight of psychology for all time: Man is a union of opposites, of self-consciousness and physical body. (Becker)
- When evolution gave man a self an inner symbolic world of experience, it split him in two, gave him added burden. This burden seems the price that had to be paid in order to attain more life, experience and self-consciousness. (Becker)
- Real differences between us and chimps is the mythical glue that binds us. (Sapiens)
