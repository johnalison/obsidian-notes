# Paradoxes                                                             

- Paradox of the Mind: When we look, mind seems totally insubstantial, yet everything we experience is a modification of the mind. 
- We spend most of our time trying to change What Is into What Should Be.  Turns out that this change is often easiest after we truly accept what is.
- We are identical with one of the greatest mysteries in the Universe. In a sense its the only thing we know, can know. In another, it is one of the last great unknowns (to science).
- Incompleteness Theorem:     "There is more to truth that provability in the deductive system" /     Arithmetic truth out runs formal provability / Truth values of undecidable statements can be decided by embedding them in a richer structure. Also common practice of mathematicians, eg: invoke structures far richer than a statement they are trying to prove. /   - No consistent theory can prove its own consistency /
- How can humans, physical organisms in a physical universe, have knowledge of a casually inert realm of abstract objects?
- Ever since the French revolution, people throughout the world have gradually come to see both equality and freedom as fundamental values. Yet the two values contradict each other.
- The more you examine your mind, the more you discover there is no fixed truth to who you are as a person. Your very efforts to improve your experince,  are generally what prevents you from understanding the depth and beauty of the most ordinary moments in life. To seek happiness in all the usual ways is to overlook it now. 
- Consequence of the Availability-misweighing tendency:
     - One consequence is that extra vivid evidence, being so memorable and thus more available in cognition, should often be underweighed while less vivid evidence should be over-weighed.

- We are gods with anuses (Becker)
- The basic insight of psychology for all time: Man is a union of opposites, of self-consciousness and physical body. (Becker)
- When evolution gave man a self an inner symbolic world of experience, it split him in two, gave him added burden. This burden seems the price that had to be paid in order to attain more life, experience and self-consciousness. (Becker)
- Real differences between us and chimps is the mythical glue that binds us. (Sapiens)
