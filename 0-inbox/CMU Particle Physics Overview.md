Can roughly think of the work in particle physics as broken down into four-quadrants

1st axis is theory vs experiment

# Will start with Theory
- Other axis is energy scale or (distance scale) probed. 
- "Medium Energy Scale" probes extremely small distance scales Quantum Chromo Dynamic or "strong force". Think we have the right theory, incredibly hard to make predictions from it. 
- "High Energy Scale" probes even smaller distances. Know we don't have the right theory. CMU group is a leader in technique principled/systematic approach of understanding how physics at one scale effects physics at another. 

# Moving to experiment.
- Same rough split: 
- Even smaller scale (smallest we can probe) directly LHC or indirectly through Bell2-2
- This science is data heavy:  use of ML/AI callobrations with stats. data science deptartments
- Requires dedicated detectors: build and commission at CMU

# Experiment 


Theory: 
- Broad expertise 


# Follow-ups
