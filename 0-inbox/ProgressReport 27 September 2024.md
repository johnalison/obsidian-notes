# 4b
Lots of progress on code base: PSData and trigger weights debugged. Added 4 tag data skims. Outputing datasets to eos. Flags to config different options. Now synthretirc data more or less integrated into production running. Starting a more detailed look at performance of synthetic data. PDFs by year. ect. 

 Getting production ready running.  Adding flags to config synthetic data properly. Added PSeudo data / Debugged trigger code

Low pt analysis starting.  Understand how we will do the three tag veto. Everything else should be straight forward.

Still no progress on FvT or SvB debugging. Chuyuan is working on getting the output properly debugged. Once this is done number of questions: gain on kλ from SvB refit / FvT with ZZ/ZH SRs, tt vs no tt.

# X→HH→4b
More chatting with Sindhu. Hard to tell if we are actually making progress. Would be nice to see come concrete steps forward. eg: slides that she starts building on.  She is currently debugging double peak. And will start looking into running systematics on mixed data. We need a talk in B2G and a MC request.


# bbWW
Still debugging neutrino reconstruction.
Need to set up unit tests and have Sam and me play around with. 

# HGC
Still kind of in coasting mode. We now have Si in the lab, need to get teh new cabinets setup and to get a really nice humidity monitoring system going. (Maybe a good use for the postgres DB)

# Sos
Wes is making sense of the combine fits. Lot of the problem was missing Bkg predictions in bins that had observed data.  Needs to repeate the scans then move forward with the apporval.
