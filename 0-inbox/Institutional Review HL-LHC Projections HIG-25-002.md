CMU Comments

- Higgs factor has 1e6 Higgs compared to 1e8 at HL-LHC

Comments: 
- Confusing: Two different per-experiment integrated luminosity (L) scenarios are considered at a centre-of-mass energy s =14 TeV: 2 ab−1 and 3 ab−1 of data for physics analysis. The centre-of-mass energy is kept at 13.6 TeV,
- 522: dont we need Λ >> v?   seems like Λ = 1 and v = sqrt(2) 
- Figure 6, "ole" -> "pole"
