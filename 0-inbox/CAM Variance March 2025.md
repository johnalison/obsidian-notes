# 402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB

Cummulative SV
- -465k 
	- 373k + 10
		-  -216k + -27k + 5 8 %
		- -115k + -15k + 5 16%
	- -42k
		- Cleanroom consubalbes 
	- -10 k 
		- Shipping
	- -39k
		- Support

There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$465k in the cost account 
402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB.  The variance has two pieces:
1) -421k Assembly, testing and shipping of full-size equivalent odd-sized modules 1-16%
2) - 37k for supporting production at other assembly site

This variance is expected due to missing input parts: hexaboards and baseplates. 

It is expected that UCSB will start the assembly of modules once parts will become available.
The will start with 12 HD full 120um Ti.

In the mean time, the ordering of the final assembly tooling is complete; the second batch of tools have been checked out and shipped to CMU and TTU.  UCSB has been continuing tests on the irradiated modules with Ti baseplate

# Current
Since funding from the FNAL subaward became only available at UCSB recently, the submitted accruals reflect a lump sum of several months of labor for module assembly at UCSB submitted to catch up with charges that could only now be charged to the relevant CA causing a current CV.

# 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2

Schedule VAriance 
- -214k
	- - 50k  Assemble and test 1-80 
	- - 140k: 81-240
	- - 22k cleanroom consumables

There is a schedule variance of -$214k in the cost account 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2 (CMU).  The variance is from the assembly and testing of the first 240 modules and the associated cleanroom consumables.

This variance is expected due to missing input parts: hexaboards and baseplates. At CMU, we have ~40 baseplates and hexaboards (v3b) and have begun assembly. We have made 22 v3b-modules.  The final tooling (Si pickup tools and trays) is being shipped to CMU now. Module construction is currently proceeding at a rate of 2/day, we will move to 4/day with the new tooling. We have recently received 15 hexaboards with ROC v3c. Our near term priority is to produce modules with v3c chips + Ti baseplates. Once supplies are exhausted we will continue with v3b + CuT baseplates. 

# Impact
The activities contributing to the cumulative SV is due to upstream delay of input parts and will be completed later than scheduled.  When the input parts become available the value will be earned and it should not impact the overall schedule.

# 402.04.04.02 CE - Module Factories

Cumulative

- -340k
	- -140
		- -80: Delivery of production module teststands
		- -60: HV and Dry air
	- -92 + 12 Final module tooling
	- -45 test stands 
	 - -42: shipping cases / thermal testing unit
	- -8: Travel 
# Follow-ups

There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$340k in the cost account 
402.04.04.02 CE - Module Factories  The variance has three pieces:
- - 220k for delivery of production test stands and associated infrastructure 
- -100k for support and delivery of final module tooling
- -20k for purchase of shipping cases

This is a result of delays in the thermal unit design and delivery of testing electronics. The current estimate is that the testing electronics will be shipped in a few weeks to CMU, TTU and UCSB in time for the MAC ramp-up. A decision on the shipping crates has been made an purchases have started.  The procurement of the final tooling is well under way and much of this value should be earned this month.  The test infrastructure will also be ordered shortly, once the statement of work is available at CMU.
