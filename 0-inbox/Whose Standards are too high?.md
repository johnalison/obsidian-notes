- Any "Serious" candidates giving speaches sounds like C students giving presentations

# Arguments that current system is OK
- US is one of best places to live. Polititians cant be that bad 
- Candidates are smarter than they seem. Look at what they do not what they say.
- You dont have to be that smart to run the country
- Its really just entertainment
- Be happy your not in a dictatorshop

-  Free market is an alternative to demacracy and dictatorship

# Politicians all have to attack this system to justify: govement regulation and government speading
- Subtext of all political speaches ... "I have found it necessary to deny the free market in order to make room for government".... (Compare: “I have found it necessary to deny reason in order to make room for faith.”-- Kant)

# Common complaints agianst the free market
- sometime leads to monopoly, need to step in 
- sometimes customers have imperfect information
- Externalities 
- People dont give enough to charity
- sometimes people fail to hire the best person

Politicians standards for the free market are too high
