Very good, as expected. Changed how I think about Democracy 

# [[Sensible Public Opinion is a Public Good ]]

- [[The rationality of irrational voters]]
- [[Irrationality in Markets vs Democracy]]




[[Markets underrated vs democracy]]




The big three systematic economic errors of the public
- anti-maket bias: people fail to see that markets lead to a dynamic equalibrium that turns private greed into public good
- anti-foreign bais: people underestimate the value in cooperating with others
- make-work bias: people see employment as more important than production
- pessimistic bias: people think the economy is bad and getting worse
