Good in places bad in others. At times he reminds me of DFW at his best, at others his style is much too much. 

I think this book was probably more important when it came out, I basically understood most of it already from Sean Carrols book on time.  The QM part was weak, basically dismisses many worlds completely out of hand without considering it seriously.
