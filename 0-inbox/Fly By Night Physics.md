Very good. Learned a lot. Need to read more his stuff!

There are only three dimensions: Mass, Length and Time.
Nobody knows why there are three and only three.

That fact that we have three fundemental constants of nature; GN, c, hbar, means we can describe all of these dimensions in natrual scale. Suggests we have found all the core physics principles ? 

By using energy conservation you effectively integrated the equations of motion to turn a second derivative in time into the square of a first derivative. 

Einstein used symmetry to determine the laws of motion. Before him, physicists determined the laws of motion and looked at them to see which symmetries where relevant.
