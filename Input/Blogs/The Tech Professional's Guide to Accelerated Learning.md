- Real learning happens when you actively engange with the material, much better than than rereading or copying. 
- Strategic Note taking: Active engagement with material
	1) Write note in YOUR OWN WORDS
	2) Create links to other notes
	3) Document questions (and try to answer them!) and doubts
	4) Create examples
- Writing things in your own words helps you to spot things you dont fully understand

Avoid taking notes with out processing them

Document everything! 
- Decision making process 
- What you actually did
- Problems / Solutions
- Resources that helped you
