- Many people commit the diamond/water fallacy, the fallacy of thinking that water should be more expensive than diamonds, because water is a necessity of life while diamonds are not. The price of anything (including labor) is determined not by the value of that _type_ of thing as a category, but by the _marginal_ value of the thing, i.e., the value added by an extra bit of it. Given how much water there is on Earth, the value of _an extra bit_ of water is minimal.
