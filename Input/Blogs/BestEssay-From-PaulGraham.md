- To start writing an essay, you need a topic plus some initial insight about it, and you can't generate those systematically. If only.

- While breadth comes from reading and talking and seeing, depth comes from doing

- You can't learn everything, so getting breadth implies learning about topics that are very different from one another.  book topics should be a laundry list of unrelated subjects
