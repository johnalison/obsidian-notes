Stephen Wolfram 

Implements machine learning in -- what else -- cellular automata.  Overall Interesting, but not clearly related to traditional ML.  Probably some interesting ideas about how to really compress the size of networks, might be interesting for implementation in hardware.

Typical Wolfram grandiose claims and statements not really backed up by much. 
Lots of repetition; he needs an editor.
