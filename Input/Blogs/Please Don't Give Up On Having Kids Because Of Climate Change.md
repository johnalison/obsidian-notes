  -) Climate change not an existential threat. 

  -) Sea rise is annoying, but not transformational (except for low lying cities)

  -) Climate change will probably not be a big effect for people living in the first world. 
     have already gotten about 25% of the global warming we are likely to see by 2100

  -) Your parents had you despite the existential serious risk of nuclear war. 

  -) Now, in the 1st world is by far the best time to live in
   history. If you think you should have kids b/c thier quality of
   life wont be as good, this implies that you dont think anyone in
   the third world should have children

  -) Not many people are likely to not have children from climate change, maybe 5% max.
  Likely to have a bigger effect on national politics than on carbon emission. 
  
  -) the children of parents not concerned about climate change will
   be less likely themselves to be concerned with climate change.

  -) Could also just have kids and pay a carbon offset.
