- All of the big, well-known differences between men and women that almost everyone has noticed are naturally derived from this one underlying explanatory factor, the difference in parental investment between men and women.

- The above differences are all cross-cultural, and most of them are even cross-_species_. E.g., even males of _other species_ are more violent than females. If you don’t think human males have an instinct for aggression, then what you must be saying is that at some time in our evolutionary past, the instinct was _selected out_, and then replaced by cultural mechanisms that induce you to do the same thing. That is ridiculous.

- I think you can see, if you look at it impartially and not ideologically, that the above explanations are very plausible and much more satisfying than the explanation, “Culture taught men and women to be like that.”
