- Anti-fragility:

  > Something is fragile if it easily breaks, robust if it does not
  break under stress, and anti-fragile if it gets stronger or improves
  under stress.  Lots of stoic thoughts about how to improve under
  stress.  Important to be able to try many low cost experiments and
  iterate.  Think about what makes you anti-fragile. and where and how
  you can fail.  How can you optimize worse case scenarios?

  > Example of Anti-fragility (Jocko): Stresses (eg: not sleeping
    enough) actually makes him a better performer. More alert, more
    responsive, emotionally engaged.

- Law of diminishing returns.

   > Example of 80/20.  Get the low hanging fruit.  Acquire breath of
   knowledge at the 80/20 level.  Then choose what long sloughs to
   fight.
