Probably not worth doing PCA on latent spaces because downstream classifiers sees such different performance. (If it was just differences in projections, the classifier performance would be the same)

Discussed paper plan

**Test**
- Try sub-sample 3b as "4b", should see closure
- sub-sample 3b + systematic by hand shift,  show robust against variation 
- then 4b

Check 2nd FvT modelling in the CR !
