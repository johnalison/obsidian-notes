Production planning plan and discussion: Althaea: 
- priority is v3c
- Assembly tooling for partials with FNAL purchasing
- US MACs provide a small quantity of CuW modules to cover imbalance of CuW>Ti in the detector
- CMU: 412 Ti+ 30 CuW modules
	- 40 April / 80 May / 120 90 + 30 June / 160 July / Rest Aug

Suzzena: 
- Xometry order is still with FNAL purchasing dept.
- Module transport box
- Need to order the remainder of HD-Full and all partials tape (– Lead time ~8 weeks)
- Have 100 ea. Double module foam sets for HD-Full (ships 200 HD-Fulls) at each US MAC

UCSB Status: 
- Recieved parts from CERN: 37 hexaborads v3b / 5 trophy boards 
- Testing HD hexaboards
- • We will resume module assembly for HD Full next
- Will build a few "no tape" modules to validate FEA studies


CMU Status: 
-  Scaling up productivity and capacity
- nstructions for configuring LV code at each MAC
- Debugging loss of channel related to transfer tape application jig pin... 
- Looking at improving humidity control
- Assembling two modules per day for one week - done 
- Preparing new tooling for four modules per day

DB Status : 
- Upload of protomodules and modules to CMSR
- Database Updates: Track contents of a single shipped package
- Generates a CSV file that can be uploaded to the CERN Shipment Tracking Tool.
