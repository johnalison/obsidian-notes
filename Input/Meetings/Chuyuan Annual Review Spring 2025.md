- Why does it not matter much to get the pairing right so long as the event is in the SR ?
- Probably in September

# Summary of research progress within past year. 

Chuyuan successfully conducted the analysis to search for the VHH production in the Higgs to bb and W/Z boson to jj final state. The QCD background is modeled using a data-driven method adopted from our previous ZZ/ZH analysis and the systematic uncertainty is estimated in the VHH phase space. Besides the cut based event selection, a deep neural network is fit to maximize the signal background separation. The result is combined with other VHH analysis in the V leptonic decay channels and an upper limit on the VHH production cross section is observed to be 288 times of the Standard Model prediction. The Higgs self-coupling is constrained between -37.7 and 37.2 times of the Standard Model prediction. The work is published in the Journal of High Energy Physics.

After the publication, the alternative simplified background fitting methods are studied to understand the impact of each component on the systematic uncertainty.

# Summary of research plan and recommendations of committee:

The committee was impressed with Chuyuan's progress. In particular, he has already executed and published the VHH analysis in the Journal of High Energy Physics.

The committee recommends that Chuyuan focus he should focus on the "end-game": set a thesis defense date, write draft of the thesis, and start preparing post-doc applications. We would also encourage Wes to give talks/seminars at a number of universities after back from CERN.
