Model-Agnostic Detection of New Physics using Data-Driven Signal Regions

Usually test for presence of signal with:
- known signal model
- known background model

Often dont have a precise background model
- need data-driven background (assumption)

EXAMPLE of sideband fit 1D 
Example in 2D

Here also want to relax the assumption that we know the signal ! 

Assume:
- signal is localized. 
- more signal S/sqrt(B) in the 4b data

EXAMPLE toy 1D
- Cutting on p4/p3 is sensitive to background mismodeling 
- Instead use low-pass filter
- SvB ratio of two FvT / smeared-FvT
