# Pre-Production Planning (Alethea)
- Wrapping up preseries
- UCSB build 5 LD right for irradiation campaign
- CMU done with pre-series

- Waiting for hexaboards hope for Nov.  Limit by ROC availability 
- Calendar 
	- Nov: 2 modules /day x week (one gantry tray). 
	- Dec: 4/day x week (one gantry tray)
	- Jan-Feb recieve tooling and multi-module test stands
	- March: 4 /day for 4 days
	- April:    8 /day for 4 days
	- May:   12 /day for 4 days 	- 

(What does preproduction mean ? Could go on the detector... 3b chips.. number produced still less than the number of spares)

# ESD susceptibility of Hexaboards (Fakri)
- confirmed source of dead half chip is due to ESD damage
- Capacitance of silicon 47 pF
- Maybe apply a shunt during assembly?

# Glue/Encapsulation studies (Chiara)
-  first a module with no epoxy on the perimeter has been built and thermal cycled
- All the modules built with the new glue/tape pattern do not show noisy channels identified during assembling procedure 
- Covering CM capacitor with encapsulate helps protecting chips against failures - This should be done before getting hexaboard to MACs since is time consuming

# Engineering update (Suzzane)
- US MAC Assembly tooling order: Xometry ~16 days
- (Asia MACs Xometry also ?)

Had to leave. requested recording.

# Laminated Baseplate Pre-Production  (Markus)
- Stresses minimal for Titanium
- Baseplate production needs to stay ahead of MAC pre-production ramp up schedule

# Local Database Ecosystem (Sindhu)
- Nice introduction... Need to watch video

# TTU MAC Updates
- Assembled another pre-series module: BP-Si: Transfer Tape Si-Hex: Hybrid Tape
- IV breakdown at 400V
- Exercising  local and global databases
