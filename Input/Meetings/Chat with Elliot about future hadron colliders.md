- Idea is a staged a hadron machine
- 12T can get you 75 TeV
	- Power of cooling is an issue
	- Hope to get high-T superconductors to cool to 10-20K vs 2-4K now
- Maybe use LHC magnets and go to 40 TeV
-  How good can we get $\kappa_\lambda$ at 40 TeV ? 

Dates: March European strategy (some kind of document)
July 16 4pm (CERN)

Idea: Top mass at the HL-LHC / future colliders vs pole mass?
