# Summary
This is the extention of the maximum likelihood estimator when you have less information. 
eg: when fitting for data for signal and background. If S(x) and B(x) are known, then MLE is the best. However if you dont know B(x) but only some condition on B(x) eg: smoothly falling.
Then this is the optimal estimator.

Alternatives would be: 
- f-tests to determine the order of the Bkg (need family of functions)
- Assume Try various families of functions ala H→γγ

# Notes

Semi parametric inference 

Is there any place for semi-parametric

"Efficeint influence function"- finding this is an art.
