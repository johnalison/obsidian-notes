# Intro and Overview:

HGCRocs:
- v3b:  ~1k chips (ordered more 25 wafer => 10% total this summer for module pre-production)
- v3c: 30% (75 wafers) ordered end of 2024

# Schedule (P.Bloch)
- The schedule is currently driven by HGCROC availability
- If the HGCROC v3C recently submitted is satisfactory, will do 75 by end of year
- unclear whether ROC3B is suitable for HDs
- have to confirm the PLL radiation issue (not corrected in ROC3C) can be coped with for highly irradiated modules such as the 120um HDs

- Irradiation of Partials
	-  C-Fiber likely to be ok for the CE-H
- UCSB 5 LR-R modules with Ti baseplates (50Mrad irradiation planned)
- Ideas for addressing ESD vulnerabliity:
	- Shunt HV to GND for handling and module building, remove for testing – CERN/UMN looking into this –
	- Encapsulate the exposed metal on the common mode capacitors. Has advantage that can easily be added as a step in the industrial final assembly.
- Investigating new expoxy patter:
	-  No epoxy on the periphery near GR (noisy channels fix) 
	-  Encapsulate exposed common mode capacitors on hexaboard with paths to HGCROC (ESD fix)
- Schedule:
	- Sep: Finish pre-series modules
	- Oct: 2 modules per day x 1 week (one gantry tray)
	- Nov-Dec: 4 modules per day x 1 week (one gantry tray)
	- March 4 / day x 3 days (w/new trays)
	- April 8/ day x 3
	- May 12/day x 3
