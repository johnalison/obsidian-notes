# Logs

## [[12 March 2025 Wednesday]]
- Coffea25 code runing 10x faster than before
- will ping FNAL re:code structuring
- will ping Fikri re:Run3 samples


## [[26 February 2025 Wednesday]]
- AE: has nano recipe from Frikri ... only goes down to 15 GeV... iterating. 
- AK: setting up new coffea framework 
- Plan to meet with coffeea experts to discuss framework setup

## [[12 February 2025 Wednesday]]
- Will start moving to new coffea version and to run3

## [[29 January 2025 Wednesday]]
- Aniket to give slides next meeting

## [[5 December 2024 Thursday]]
- Prep talk for bbWW

## [[31 October 2024 Thursday]]
- Not much.  Chi2 using mean of the signal distribution !

## [[26 September 2024 Thursday]]
- AE: Running jobs
- AK: will debug w-mass constraint by trying to fit by hand... Sam will help
- SD: running on lxplus

## [[19 September 2024 Thursday]]
 Aniket
- Will add unit test to do the neutrino reweighting
 Alejandro
- Calibration results for all years

## [[12 September 2024 Thursday]]
- Aniket: Processor too slow... b/c running all systematics. Will turn off. 
- ttbar Chi2 now looks good.
- Not much else...

## [[5 September 2024 Thursday]]
- Aniket: getting the new processor going
- AGE:  discussion of working with ETH 
- Not much else

## [[29 August 2024 Thursday]]
- Aniket still sees weird chi2 problems
- Needs to define the W*->qq  vs W->qq using the truth information 

## [[22 August 2024 Thursday]]
 Aniket
- Chi2 scale off will remake (likely bug)
- Will start making comprehensive slides
- Discussion of various chi2 terms


## [[15 August 2024 Thursday]]
 Aniket
- Bug in w-mass constraint 
- Will make X_HH and X_tt 

- Separately for W* -> qq and W->qq

- For W*->qq:
	 X_HH include mass terms for both higges
- For W->qq:
	 Only have H->bb can try adding mT leptonic W and pZ neutrino 

 Alejandro 
- Has JEC corrections in hand
- Will present to JERC in two weeks and ask about need for JER


## [[8 August 2024 Thursday]]
 Aniket
- Good plots
- mTop looks buggy, signal at ttbar are too close.
- mH looks OK
- WIll update slides with jet selection

 Sam
- looking into s vs B

 Sena
- progress on code

## [[1 August 2024 Thursday]]
- Only aniket
- Making good progress! 



## [[25 July 2024 Thursday]]
- https://indico.cern.ch/event/1432491/

- Can sign up on:
	cms-hh-bbvv@cern.ch

- Alejandro
	- Has response scale corrections.
	- What about resolution ? Will look into
	- Trying to use Matteos processor, but problem with saving histograms
	- (Will not make it next meeting)

-  Sena 
	- Back from holidays
	- Problem running on the Korean cluster

- Aniket
	- fix for Wasnt plotting the tru
	- Looks like the Higgs mass plots are switched. 
	- Post slides to agenda. 

- Sam 
	- Making progress on plotting


## [[11 July 2024 Thursday]]
- Comparing the top 3 qvsq jets
- Looking into the leading p_t. Can probably require only the leading to be
