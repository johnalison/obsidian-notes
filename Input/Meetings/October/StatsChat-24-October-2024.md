Very good discussion ! 
- Null looks OK 
- With signal present we see that the background prediction is biased by CR signal contamination when fitting FvT using the original latent space (found by fitting SvB).
- When fitting the FvT from the original inputs the results look good.
- This suggests that impact of the signal contamination in the CR depends strongly on the latent space used in the FvT. (Swiss cheese vs Blue cheese).  When using the original ("SvB") latent space the FvT sees the CR signal contamination as swiss cheese, and the signal contamination in the CR biases the background prediction in the SR. When the FvT latent space is re-derived using only events in the CR,  the FvT now sees the CR signal contamination as blue cheese, and there is little (if any bias) on the background prediction in the SR.
