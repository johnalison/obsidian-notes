- From Barney:
	- I strongly suggest you follow the P2UG presentations by HGCAL that happen 1-2 times per year, as this sort of thing is always mentioned. You can look at Paul's presentation at the November P2UG ([https://indico.cern.ch/event/1471927/contributions/6197528/attachments/2959391/5207889/HGCAL%20Electronics%20P2UG%205Nov24.pdf](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1471927/contributions/6197528/attachments/2959391/5207889/HGCAL%20Electronics%20P2UG%205Nov24.pdf)) for a reasonable summary of the status of the Hexaboards. 

- Since November:

	- about 1500 more LD Full Hexaboards received at CERN (bare). Visual inspection done on a sampling basis - all very good
	- 60 LD Full assembled with HGCROC3C before Christmas and tested recently: look good (with the provisos of 3C of course)
	- Orders placed with an assembly company (one we know well) for assembly of another ~900 boards - mostly Full, but also some partials - to get the MACs producing modules for the pre-series cassettes and to prove (again on a sampling basis) that the batches of PCBs are ok. These assemblies should all be done with 3C. 
	- Invitations to Tender for mass assembly will be launched at the end of this week, with mass assembly then due to start around April/May


## [[7 January 2025 Tuesday]]

- Our meeting today will focus on the risk register, where we need to take  
a number of actions, and the planning of a set of BCRs which we need to  
attack to be able to properly budget for production as well as to defend  
our plans during the DOE progress review in June.

- Motherboard updates: will produce some LD engines (have PCBs) only enough to get started, while we figure out lpgt situation.  (~100)

- HD wagon back, starting to work on
- LD wagon pretty advanced, PCB order soon (limited until Dec. b/c wag side of engine <-> wagon supply delay)

- Modules Baseplates... 22nd 23rd. 29th
- Who to bug about baseplates?

- Propose to finish l163 (odd-size preseries)

- Need to mark completed in tab "Comp Status-DOE"

- Racheal to send CMU ~125 sensors next week. 

- We need 300 micron LD partials early 
- The HD partials see the most radiation and will need the best componets to survive. 

- ROC v3-b is the chip with probems

- v3-c 
- LD require 3 chips / module
- HD require 6 chips / module

- Might be possible for v3-d

- BCR: everything outside freeze to sit on working schedule dates

## [[23 July 2024 Tuesday]]
