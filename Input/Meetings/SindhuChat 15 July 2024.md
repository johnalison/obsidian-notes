Discussed that there has to be an excess of data events in the bins in which the data probability is higher than 0.5, by construction.


$$p_D = \frac{D}{D+B}$$
$$ p_D = \frac{D/B}{1+D/B}$$

$$ p_D = D/B - p_D D/B$$
$$ D/B = \frac{p_D}{1-p_D} $$

eg: $p_D  = 0.7$  => D/B = 0.7 / 0.3 ~ 2.3

Sindhu not convinced,  will try out with a toy with unweighed background events then will add background events.

Plot form the optimal transport paper that shows this effect:

The orange (before the FvT kinematic reweight) has data vs Bkg mis-modelling that is in a one-to-one correspondence with the FvT classifier output value.   (here the FvT is defined as p4/p3 not p4 / (p4 + p3)).
