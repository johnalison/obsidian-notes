Discussed idea for small author paper re:strategy with using fourier coefficients for systematics.
  
## Chris' thoughts

1. Describe how many systematics assume a simple band for the systematic systematic variation. 
2. Perhaps mention also a good example (e.g. background modeling with free parameters like in Hγγ). 
3. Make a toy that will fail to adequately cover truth with just a banded systematic.  
4. Show that basis will be able to recover the truth without biased signal strength.
    - Somewhere need to describe orthogonalization of the basis. 
5. Show that many bases would do the same job. 
    - Is the order of the basis dependent on the basis choice?

Will have student ____name____ (Jake?) looking into it.

Sent pointer to code and runTwoStage closure.
