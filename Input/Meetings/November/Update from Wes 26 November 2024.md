SUSY-SOS Analysis:  

- I was able to produce some preliminary fits with the full reweighting procedure (BR + mll). I am waiting on a few fits that I resubmitted to htcondor. But the limits look pretty good (except where any mass points are missing).
- We wanted to give an update presentation to the conveners on all material answering the last questions and the J/psi reweighting but it has been pushed back to next week because of some conflict on their end.  Hopefully some approval on the J/psi veto will be given such that the final binning can be derived for everything (including the mll reweighting).

  

HGCAL:

- I performed a few injection scans at different temperatures on a non-irradiated HD module. I noticed a small dependence on the temperature for the ADC to fC conversion but I am still looking into how large of an effect this will have on the CCE measurements. Maybe applying uncertainties is enough to cover the dependence.
- I also noticed during these scans, some issues with the calibrations in some channels that are not consistent between measurements (spikes in the conversion factor). Other than these few channels (<10 channels), the conversion factor looks relatively stable (the same) across all channels on the module.  

  

Exo Workshop Talk:

- I met with the analyzers of EXO-24-017 (the boosted ditau search) and discussed their analysis in a bit more detail with them. Although they could not say what the run3 plans are for their search other than that someone will likely perform it. They also pointed me to more presentations on the topic than the conveners were able to send.

  

Annual Review:

- I am almost finished with an initial draft that I can send you. 
- Set date for Dec 10th (9-10a EST)

  

Thesis:

- I am also done writing the first full draft of the document. I currently have some placeholder figures for things like CR/SR plots where I would like to eventually replace them with the final post-fit versions. Similar status for the interpretations as well.
