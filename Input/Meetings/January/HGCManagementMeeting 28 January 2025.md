[[Module assembly at CMU]]


Moves:
l81: ECM: Test standard PCB batch 1 (First 5%) to 20%
l157: ECM-Assemble and test module 1-80 at Site 2
l158 ECM- Supervise assembly and testing of modules 1-80 at Site 2

From Barney:
- I strongly suggest you follow the P2UG presentations by HGCAL that happen 1-2 times per year, as this sort of thing is always mentioned. You can look at Paul's presentation at the November P2UG ([https://indico.cern.ch/event/1471927/contributions/6197528/attachments/2959391/5207889/HGCAL%20Electronics%20P2UG%205Nov24.pdf](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1471927/contributions/6197528/attachments/2959391/5207889/HGCAL%20Electronics%20P2UG%205Nov24.pdf)) for a reasonable summary of the status of the Hexaboards. 

Since November:

- about 1500 more LD Full Hexaboards received at CERN (bare). Visual inspection done on a sampling basis - all very good
- 60 LD Full assembled with HGCROC3C before Christmas and tested recently: look good (with the provisos of 3C of course)
- Orders placed with an assembly company (one we know well) for assembly of another ~900 boards - mostly Full, but also some partials - to get the MACs producing modules for the pre-series cassettes and to prove (again on a sampling basis) that the batches of PCBs are ok. These assemblies should all be done with 3C. 
- Invitations to Tender for mass assembly will be launched at the end of this week, with mass assembly then due to start around April/May
