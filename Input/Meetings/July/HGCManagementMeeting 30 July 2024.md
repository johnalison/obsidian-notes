Racheal to send CMU ~125 sensors next week. 

We need 300 micron LD partials early 
The HD partials see the most radiation and will need the best componets to survive. 

ROC v3-b is the chip with probems

v3-c 
LD require 3 chips / module
HD require 6 chips / module

Might be possible for v3-d


BCR: everything outside freeze to sit on working schedule dates
