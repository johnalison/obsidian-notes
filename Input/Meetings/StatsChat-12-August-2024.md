Smearing the 4b to get rid of the high frequency modes
- Smear the 6d input space.
- Not clear how to fix the smearing scale / can do a scan.
- Seems like good idea

Looks like the clustering in rho / (distance to point with higher rho) also working

Can probably use this to show that the smearing is working.
