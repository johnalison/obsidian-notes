-) Figure 2 labels on the feynman diagram

- To remove events with a misreconstructed /pT due to the jet energy resolution, events are
218 discarded where at least one jet has a transverse momentum (pjet) greater than 30GeV, and
219 ∆φmin(jet, /pT ) > 0.5.

- Should be dphi < 0.5 ?!
- What is the efficeincy of this selection ? Large theory uncertianties associated with the modeling of the QCD radiation ?
  Done see an explicit ISR/FSR modelling uncertianty in Section 8. Is there one ? 

284) Templates for spike and beam halo are obtained from dedicated control regions in data.

Would be good to say a few senstances about how these are defined.

l303) Seems like this beam halo veto is new to this analyis.
      Might be nice to include a plot showing the rejection. (and the fit to phi)


-Section 10.1:
  Suprised to not see the jet-veto here.
  How much of the fiducial cross section comes from evetns that would fail the jet veto used in the measurement ?
