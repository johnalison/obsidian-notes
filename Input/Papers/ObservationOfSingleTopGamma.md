Observation of Single-Top-Quark Production in Association with a Photon Using the ATLAS Detector

- directly probes the electroweak coupling of the top quark.

- These processes play a crucial role in constraining nonresonant contributions from physics beyond the SM (BSM)

-  radiation before the top-quark decay is of particular interest.
