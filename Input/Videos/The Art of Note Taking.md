Writing notes skillfully is the only thing that really matters.

Your notes are the place where you do your deepest and best thinking.

Be a "note maker" not a "note taker". 

- Dont copy and paste
- Convert information into your own knowledge assets 
- Cultivate and refine

Write in your own words: this should feel hard/challenging

Difficulties signal that you need to go deeper into the subject. 


WRITE YOU NOTES IN YOUR OWN WORDS!!!
- JA: should I do this with book notes ?

Curate dont collect!

Note development is like meditation or exercise.

See your note making as a craft...Refine dont rush.
