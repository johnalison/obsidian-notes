How to give a good speech. 

Dont necessarily need to put the punch line at the end.
- Sometime worth risk of putting it at the end
- "point last" only sometimes for some purposes.

You need to make a text coherence 
- This is not about logical coherence 
- Its not abstract, not conceptual 
- mainly an experience that an audiance has

Can create coherence from language

Examples that everyone knows:
- Past -> Present -> Future
- Birth -> Death -> Re-Birth

When readers read text to understand the world
	Readers -> text -> world
They use subjects as the focus of the sentence.

The passive verb myth does an enormous amount of damage ! They are needed to shift the attention to the right place to control the subject position.

Its a terrible idea to vary the opening of your sentences. 

Chaining is OK for a few sentences, but you will loose readers if too much (eg: more than ~5)
