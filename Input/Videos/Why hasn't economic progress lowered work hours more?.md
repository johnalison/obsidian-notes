Key question: Is progress real, or is it an illusion ? 

John Maynard Kaynes in 1930 says by 2030 we should have a work week of 15 hours.
  (Who is really benefiting from modernity ?) 

Income effect - as you get paid more... at some point you can take it easy and work less
Substitution effect  - (opposite implication) if you get paid more to do something, you do more of it.

 The wealthiest people use their opportunity to work more ... substitution effect is larger for top 1%

Compared to the 19th C we are working less..  ~60 hrs / week then ~40 hrs/ week now
- Income effect has been stronger 
- Today: Rich countries work 20 hrs / person (including people not working), Poor countries 30 hrs/person

Big picture seems to be right. 

However in the US and/or more recent times ... work hours / person doesn't change from 1950 - 2000.

There are big differences across groups:
- Cut back: prime age working men / elderly / teenagers
- Working more: Women / high wage males

Keynes was completely right about the elderly. 
- Extreme bunching: We choose to consume the bulk of our leisure when we are very old

Starting wages have fallen since 2000... less work and less pay...
- No one predicted this.

The top 1% want to work, "people seem to like work more than keynes thought". 
- Big lesson in economic data "People really like work"

Is it that work is great, or that the rest of life is terrible. 

So, progress is real. But we are still working, because we like working and we like money.
