#Consume

- "Now we flourish as before others did. And soon others will whose children we shall never see."

- Death always with us, dying moment at a time.
 Important that death and its possibility color your life.

- "You always have a gun to your head: Need to make decisions have personal interactions with this in mind." - Fight Club

- **Alive time vs Dead time:**
  
   > You don't own anything! Anything you think you own goes away when
     you die, and you don't know when that is going to happen. Could
     be tomorrow or tonight. The only one thing that is yours , that
     you cant be taken away from you is time.  Guard and Value it with
     the respect it deserves.  It's all you have...

- Time is constantly running out, don't know how much you got

- Dont worry/think about things you dont like.

  > No point looking down on someone or something that you dont like
    or find interesting. Move on, drop it. There is only so much time
    and energy (via Joe Rogan)

- Time is all you have. No one can take it from you. But you can throw it away from lack of attention if you are careless / not mindful. 

- Some thoughts on time management:

  - Your time is limited. Reflect on death.
  - There are too many things you could do, need a way to decide which. (See the system) 
  - Get clear on what matters. 
  - Get good at focusing. (Use mindfulness to feel when you are pulling away, then lean back in)

- **Attention:**

   > Attention is a finite resource.
   > Is the bricks and mortar of our life.
   > Amazing how easily we let it be stolen from us.


- Should live more as if you had been diagnosed with some terminal disease and were going to die soon.

   > In fact we all have a terminal disease: “The cause of death is
     birth” and we don't know how much longer we have to live.

- “You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think” - Markus Aurelius
     
   > Put everything that takes time or attention, costs money, or
     takes sacrifice through this filter.

- Time is one think in negotiations or decision making that you can cant go back on.

   > Cant undo. Time gives no mercy.  No amount of negotiation can
  recover lost time. its gone when its gone.  Time is one thing to pay
  attention to above all. How you use *your* time.

- Ones whole life is a succession of moment after moment. 
  > "Attention is the brick and mortar of our lives". Important to guard your time the respect it deserves. 

- How to be present and Alive in the moment:  Shift from doing to being: more present, joyful, appreciative. 

  - Practice pouring yourself into every act (being fully in all/everything you do)
  - Feel emotion
  - See the good around you, in the people you interact with 

- Life isnt short, we just waste a lot of it

- "On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero."  Fight Club

- "This is your life and its ending one minute at a time." Fight Club

- If you love life you will not squander time. Its what life is made of. (Poor Richards Almanac)


- Can spend money to save time, can spend time to save money.
  - Think more about the time vs money trade-offe.  money is fungable, time you cant get back.

- Time makes up your life, wasting it is a form of suicide. (SCRUM)

- "Hawk-a-Hey" Lakota Indian war cry. Roughly translates: "Today is a good day to die"

- Meaning of events depends more on the quality of your attention that on what action is taking place.

- The only way to live with out regret is to pay attention.
