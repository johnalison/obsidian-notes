# Memento Mori: All we have is time; lack of attention throws it away

#Consume



- **Attention:**

   > Attention is a finite resource.
   > Is the bricks and mortar of our life.
   > Amazing how easily we let it be stolen from us.


- Should live more as if you had been diagnosed with some terminal disease and were going to die soon.

   > In fact we all have a terminal disease: “The cause of death is
     birth” and we don't know how much longer we have to live.

- “You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think” - Markus Aurelius
     
   > Put everything that takes time or attention, costs money, or
     takes sacrifice through this filter.



- How to be present and Alive in the moment:  Shift from doing to being: more present, joyful, appreciative. 



- Can spend money to save time, can spend time to save money.
  - Think more about the time vs money trade-offe.  money is fungable, time you cant get back.


- Meaning of events depends more on the quality of your attention that on what action is taking place.

- The only way to live with out regret is to pay attention.
