# Be the good: Intelligent ACTION is power


#Consume 

   
- Want some good ?
   > Get it for yourself.  To have a good day, do good things.

- Do what is essential. 

- “Whats the next action?” Philosophy seems to be practical/effective and clarifying. 

- Dont count on motivation for long-term results. Count on discipline. Know  what to do and make yourself do it! 


- Do the right thing because it is the right thing to do.  
   > Dont need any other reason for doing something you know is right. Only need justification to do think you know are wrong.


- "Do what nature demands of you. Get right to if its possible. Dont look around to see if people will know about it. Dont wait for perfection, be satisfied with any small progress, but push for more" Markus Aurelius

### Baltasar Gracian
   > - Knowledge without courage is sterile
   > - Excel in what is excellent.
   > - Most things are not obtained simply because they are not attempted


- Fools make feasts, wise men eat them (Poor Richards Almanac)

- Those who forget good and evil and seek only to know the facts are more likely to achieve good than those who view the world through the distortion of their own desires.

- Its often obvious what the right thing to do is, the problem is mainly one of discipline, not knowledge. 
    eg: eating right/exercising/sleep/being a dependable person

- Its not enough to have a good mind, the main thing is to use it well - Descarte

- The fruit of life is good character and acts for the common good.
