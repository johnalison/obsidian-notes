# Amor Fati: Embrace what happens, it couldn't have been otherwise.  You can only control what you can control.

[[Philosophy]]

#Consume



  > Corralling them will create an abundance of leisure and
  > tranquility.  Shouldn't forget each moment to ask: "Is this one of
  > the unnecessary things?"  Should kill both unnecessary thought and
  > actions; unnecessary thoughts lead to unnecessary actions.

- Skillful speech

   > Is it Moral ?  Is it Useful ?  Is it Productive ?

- No one can have everything that they want, but than CAN not want what they dont have and then happily put to use what they do have.
   > Wanting less is a short cut to being rich.

- When doing good deeds on the right things, who cares about the praise you receive? 
  > The praise shouldn't be why you do whats right or why you help someone out.
  > You do it b/c you control it and its they right/honest thing to do.

- "Never be overheard complaining, even to yourself" Markus Aurelius

   > Things could not have been otherwise. Dont get upset about what happens, respond. 
   > Can use complaints as a barometer or flag for when your too attached.

- There is no rule higher than that over oneself, over ones impulses (Baltasar Gracian)

- "Cnage your wish to match what actually happened"
