# Amor Fati: Embrace what happens, it couldn't have been otherwise.  You can only control what you can control.


#Consume

- Need to embrace what happens.

- You don't control what happens externally to you. You are only responsible for you choices/actions. 

  > No need to get emotional about these external events.  They, the
  > external events, don't care about you.  You need to respond to the
  > situation that has presented itself.  Emotional reactions only add
  > your suffering and limit the scope of your response.  Use
  > glimpses/mindfulness to catch/mute the reaction.

- Be the calm. Calm is contagious. 
  > Need to do more thinking before speaking.


- Reverence and Justice:
   > Leave the past behind, let fate deal with the future. Focus on Now, the present and be guided by

   > _Reverence_: love what you have been given (love what happends) Amore Fati

   > and

   > _Justice_ Speak truth freely without aversion.


- Live without fear, live without hope. Realize that you are totally free in this moment, whatever happens.

  > Hops is a disguised form of fear or of suffering


- Accept sucess without arrogance, let failure go with indifference.

  > Sucess and failure are impostors, what really matters is **who we are**

- The art of acquiesces: if something happens that you did not wish to happen, CHANGE YOUR WISH and accept what happened.

- You cannot alter the past, but you can also not make the future other than it will be. (Russell)

- Obviously you can have no effect on the past. But this does not mean that the past would not have been different if our present wishes had been different. Our present wishes are conditioned by the past and therefore could not be different unless the past was different. The past cannot be different from what it was , but no more can our present wishes be different from what they are. (Russell)

- Respond don't react

- I am the only one whose opinion really matters. I am the one who sets the standard. Use criticism/praise for what its worth, but don't look too much into it.

- Happiness, peace, stillness, well-being come from within.

- Only your choices are good or evil. Everything else just happens.

- No point being upset with what happens.  Don't take it personally. Remove emotional coloring. 

- Objective things just are. They are not good or bad. They are just information. Only *your* reactions matter. Only *your* reactions are not simply given facts.

- Nothing can prevent you from getting better, becoming wiser. The obstacle is the way.

- Vast majority of our words/actions are unnecessary

  > Corralling them will create an abundance of leisure and
  > tranquility.  Shouldn't forget each moment to ask: "Is this one of
  > the unnecessary things?"  Should kill both unnecessary thought and
  > actions; unnecessary thoughts lead to unnecessary actions.

- Skillful speech

   > Is it Moral ?  Is it Useful ?  Is it Productive ?

- No one can have everything that they want, but than CAN not want what they dont have and then happily put to use what they do have.
   > Wanting less is a short cut to being rich.

- When doing good deeds on the right things, who cares about the praise you receive? 
  > The praise shouldn't be why you do whats right or why you help someone out.
  > You do it b/c you control it and its they right/honest thing to do.

- "Never be overheard complaining, even to yourself" Markus Aurelius

   > Things could not have been otherwise. Dont get upset about what happens, respond. 
   > Can use complaints as a barometer or flag for when your too attached. 

- “Waste no time or Energy on grudges” Churchill 

- There is no rule higher than that over oneself, over ones impulses (Baltasar Gracian)

- "Cnage your wish to match what actually happened"
