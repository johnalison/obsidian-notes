## Blood Meridian (Cormack McCarthy)
  - Good. Entertaining (A lot probably went over my head). Very gory. 
  - Dont actually have much that I took away.
  - "People see what they want to see".  "Then how come I ant seeing it now? I sure as want to."
  - "Books lie", "God dont lie", No said the judge, He does not and these are his words (holds up a chunk of rock) "He speaks in stones, trees, the bones of things"
