## Breath: the new science of a lost art
 - Fantastic
 - 90% of us are breathing incorrectly, deteriorated over ages (dysevolution) 
 - molecules you breath in build your bones, (we "eat air") 
 - o2 produces 16x the energy than c0
 - Two ways body makes energy from air/food
 
   > w/o2 aerobic - after warm up body switches to aerobic during workout
 
   > w/o o2 anaerobic - uses glucose quick easy inefficient, can be toxic. What 1st min of intense exercise sucks
 
 - Interior of nose blanketed with erectile tissue. 
 - Mouth breathing ##1 cause of cavities
 - Greatest indicator of life-span is lung capacity
 - Internal organs are malleable
 - We have 100x more c02 in our bodies than o2.
 - We exhale more than we breath in, 85% of fat loss through CO2
 - CO2 is the chief hormone in the body, only one that is produced by every tissue and acts on every organ.
 - Lungs absorb only about 1/4 of the available o2
 - Prayer heals, esp when its practiced at 5.5. breaths/min
 - Just as we've been a culture of over eaters, we've also become a culture of over breathers
 - With some effort and training, breathing less can become unconscious habit. 
 - When we breath too much, expel too much c02, blood pH rises: more alkaline
 - When we breath too slow,  hold more c02 -> pH lower: more acidic.
 - All the tenderizing and cooking eventually lead to airway obstruction.
 - Breathing is the power switch to the eautonomic nervous system. 
 - Lungs connected to nerves in parasympathetic in lower lobes. Why long/slow breaths are relaxing.
 - Sympathetic nerves located on the top of the lungs
 - Vegas nerve turns organs on and off in response to stress
 - Amygdala the alarm circuit of fear
 - Chemo-receptors in brain-stem monitor changes in CO2 and alarm the brain 
 - Chemo-receptors flexibility is part of what distinguishes good and great athletes
 - Breathing slow, less and through the nose balances the level of respiratory gases in the body and send max O2 to max tissues for max electron reactivity.
 - "If I had to limit my advice on healthier living to one tip it would be to simply learn how to breath better"
 - Humming increases the release of nitric oxide in the nasal passage. 
 - Mouth-breathing causes body to lose 40% more water during sleep
 - Mouth-breathing also make you urinate more. Pituitary gland in base of brain secretes hormones that controls vasopressin, which communicates to cells to store more H20.
 - If not in deep sleep (eg from chronic sleep apnea) vasopressin wont release and we will have to urinate more.
