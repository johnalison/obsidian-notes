# The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature  (Pinker)

One of the best books Ive read.  Takes three common misconceptions: humans are a blank slate, natural things are pure|peaceful, we have free will not subject to laws of nature|genetics and shows how thinking about these the right|scientific way has major culture implications.  
Changed how I viewed: 
  - Raising childred
  - Liberal/Conservative divide
  - Feminism's fight for equality

First clear statement Ive read about what postmodernism is and why its misguided.
I think there are alot of connections here with the themes of DFW.
