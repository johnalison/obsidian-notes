# The Road to Reality (Roger Penrose)
 - "3 mysteries of reality" (biggest take away) 
      Idea: the physical world can be described by (is contained in) the mathematical world. 
      The mathematical world can be entirely discovered (?) (understood) by the mental world.
      The  mental world (consciousness) is entirely a product of the physical world. 
      Nested loop. 

   - Interesting take on particle physics "zig-zag" model of electron interactions.
   
   - Interesting discussion of Cantor's theory of the infinite and Godel's incompleteness theorem.
       (Want to read the emperors new mind)
   
   - Good take on problems with QM
