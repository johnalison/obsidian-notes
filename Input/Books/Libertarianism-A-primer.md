Great book. Changed the way I think.

- Libertarianism is the view that each person has the right to live his life in any way he chooses so long as he respects the equal rights of others.

- all human relationsships should be voluntary; the only thing that should be forbidden by law are those that involve hte inition fo force against those who have not use force themselves.

- Governments are needed to protect our rights and to protect us from others who may use force against us.

- When governments use force against people who have not violated the rights of others, the governments themselves become rights violators

- Surely in todays world the government need to do more than just that?
  SuhThe suprising answer is no. The more messy and modern the worls the better libertarianism works compared to a: monarchy, dictatorshop, and even welfarism (as we have in the postwar US). 

- We are not a prosperous as we could be

- Westerns-style big government is going through a slow-motion version of communisms collapse.

- People who dont own property dont take care of it as well as owners; same for people who own buissnesses

- The most important political value is liberty, not democracy. 
  There is a connection between liberty and democracy, but they are not identical
  eg: if we lived n a society where everyones spouse was chosen by majority vote of teh entire community,
	  we'd live in a democracy but we wouldnt have much liberty.
	  
- The most important institutions in human society -- language, law, money, and markets -- all developed spontaneously, with out central direction.

- In America today: 
  Liberals usually want more government intervention in our economic lives and less intervention in personal decisions
  Conservatives usually want less government intervention in our economic lives and more intervention in personal decisions
  Libertarianism want less intervention in both
  
- Libertarianism is not about a getting a perfect socienty but a better an freer one.

- There have always been two political philosophies: liberty and power.

- The principles of freedom was discovered first in the west becuse of the unique conflict between church and state in middle-age Europe
  
- The Declaration of Independce is probably thefines peice of libertarian writing in history. 

- "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty" - Jefferson

- Government intervention in the marketplace tends to reduce wealth and overall standard of living.

- We have an infinite numebr of right contained in one natrual right to live you life as you choose (so long as you dont infringe on the equal rights of others)
  Treating rights as tangible claims that must be limited in number gets the whole concept wrong.
  
- equality of outcomes requires a political decision about measurement and allocation, a decision no society can make withough some group forcing its view on others.
  Producing equal outcomes would requres treating people unequally.
  
- an attempt to create equality of opportunity can be as dictatorial as equality of results.

- a property right is a human right to property

- Freedom of speech is supposed to mean the right of everyong to say whatever he likes. But the big neglected questions is where?
  Where does he have this right ? Not on a property where he is trespassing.  He has this right on his own property or on that of someone who as a greed (eg: through a contract) to lem him on the premises.
  
- From each as he chooses, to each as he is chosen.

- Fundamental rights cannot conflict. Any claim of conflicting right must be a misinterpretation of fundamental rights.

- Life is full of trade-offs; better to let those trade off be made on a localized and decentralized basis than by a central authority

- To finance the Civil war, Congress aurthorized the issuing of inflationary paper money, which it declared to be "legal tender" meaning that it had to accepted in payment of debts, even if the lender had expected to be repaid in gold or silver.
