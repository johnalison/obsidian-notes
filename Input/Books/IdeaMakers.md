# Idea Makers: Personal Perspectives on the Lives & Ideas of Some Notable People  (Steven Wolfram)


Fast read. Interesting choice of figures, many I learned about for the first time here. (Ada Lovelace/Marvin Minksky/ Russle Towel / Solomon Golomb)
The last section on Solommon Golomb and shift registers was particularly good. 
Overall the book suffered bc Wolfram was constantly comparing himself and his "great new science" to these figure. 
Although I learned alot of interseting details, the book read more as propaganda for Wolfram/NKS/ and Mathematical and could have been much more effective.
