Long and not very good.  Alot that went over my head.

A very religious book.  

* All men are live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle ever-present perils of life. And if you be. a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before your evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.

- Ahab beware of Ahab; beware of thyself, old man
