# Four Thousand Weeks (Oliver Burkeman)



- Average overall.

- On almost any meaningful timescale, we will be dead any minute.
  It follows that time management should be everyone's main concern.
  All life is is time management.

[[MomentoMori]]

- However most time management books ignore the basic fact that we have so little time.

[[2-areas/Philosophy/UnpopularImportantTruth]]

- When people make enough money to meet their needs, they find new needs to need.

- We tend to spend our days "getting things done" and "out of the way" so we can eventually get to what really matters.
  We thus tend to live in the future.

- Productivity is a trap. Getting more done quickly just makes you more rushed.

- The problem isn't our limited time, its the bad ideas we have about how to use our limited time.  We subconsciously believe that if we could get enough work done, we dont need to worry about if its healthy to derive so much meaning from our work in the first place.

- Limit embracing attitude: organize your day with the explicit understanding that you wont have time to do everything you want to do.
  Need to cope with "Fear Of Missing Out"; give you limited time, you are guaranteed to miss out on almost everything.

- Meaningful productivity often comes from letting them take their time, not hurrying them.

- The technology that we use to get "everything" done more efficiently always end up failing because they increase the size of "everything"

- The more you struggle to fit everything in, the more of your time you spend on the least meaningful things.

[[TheONEThing]]


- "PLEASE READ" in email titles are usually a sign that you dont need to bother reading.

- We must live our live with the clear recognition of our limitations and that life is not a dress rehearsal, every choice requires many sacrifices and time is always running out.
  You cannot depend on a single moment of the future.

- Its incomprehensibly miraculous that we have been granted anytime at all.

- Minor frustrations have an out sized negative effect on your life and happiness over the years
  You should slightly change your orientation, so that you see yourself as lucky to be in a position to have irritating experiences.

[[Happiness]]

- The real measure of a good time management system is if it lets you neglect the right things
  - Pay yourself first
  - limit your work in progress
  - resist the allure of middling priorities


- You have to "settle" there is no other choice. The decision to refuse to settle -- eg: to spend your whole life online dating -- is also a case of settling, you are opting to use your limited time in a sub-optimal way.

- The future is more alluring than the present because you can indulge all your hopes for it, even when they contradict each other.

- Attention is not a resource.  Resources facilitate life. Attention just is life. We you pay attention to something you dont value, you are paying with your life.
  A distracted person isn't choosing, they are being captured by forces that dont have their best interests at heart.

- The online attention economy is a machine for misusing your life. It is constantly persuading you to make bad choices about how to use your attention.

- "Do you want to know what my secret is? You see, I dont really mind what happens." To the extent that we can stop demanding certainty from how things will go, well be liberated from the anxiety in the only moment that every exists, this one.
  
- The more you focus on using time well, the more each day feels like something to "get through" en route to the better future. To use time, is to treat it as a means to an end. This focuses us exclusively on where we're headed at the expense of where we are now. This tends to locate the real value in the future at a time you haven't -- and will never -- reach.

- Its fun to have fun, but you have to know how.

- If you can endure the pain of not knowing, a solution will often present itself. (Applies almost everywhere in life)

[[Boredom]]

- Patience is the least fashionable but perhaps most consequential superpower
  - Develop a taste for having problems: Life is a process of engaging with problem after problem
  - embrace radical incrementalism: be willing to stop when your day is up, even when on a roll. Strengthens the patience muscle that will allow you to return to a problem again and again
  - originality lies on the far side of unoriginality

[[Advice]] 

- The next and most useful thing is all that any of us can aspire to do an any moment.

- If you experience life with twice the usual intensity, and your experience of life will be twice as full. Meditation helps here.
