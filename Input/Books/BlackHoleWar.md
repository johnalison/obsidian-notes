# The Black Hole War: My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum Mechanics  (Susskind, Leonard)

Quick read.  General audience description of black hole duality. 
First time ive seen the duality of something falling through the event horizon and being scrambled according to an outside observer.
Lot of details of how string theory factored into the solution. Probably the best example of where string theory had an impact on physics.
