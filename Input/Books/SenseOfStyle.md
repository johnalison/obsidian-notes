# The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person's Guide to Writing in the 21st Century (Steven Pinker)

Not a good book.  Did not finish.  Got bored with the remmendations.  There was no clear big picture and the text assumed a lot of grammar jargon. 
Tree diagrams for sentances was interesing and might be one take away; also the use of the passive voice to allow subjects to appear close together in neiboring sentances.
The idea that the best writting style is one where the text is written as if someone is showing something they have discovered was also interesting.
