## Stoic Test Challenge (William Irvine)
 - Great Book!
 - Definitely changed my life for the better. 
 - Philosophy of life: what in life is worth having and what is a strategy for obtaining it. 
 - Now w/after life, but about time on earth.
 - All about stoic tests (see Respond, don't React (Employ Stoic Test Strategy))
 - What up sets people is not the setbacks in themselves, but there judgements of them.
