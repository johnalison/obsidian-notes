## Every Love Story Is a Ghost Story  (David Foster Wallace Bio)
  - Good 
  - Serous mental problems, Big pot and alcohol problems, big into AA.
  - Interested in Buddhism
  - "The world is everything that is the case" (Tractatus. Wallace though one of the best opening lines in western it.)
    - Does our understanding of what we experience derive from objective reality or from cognitive limitations with us ? (Is language window or cage?)
  - Do we have real existence outside of what we do/say/perceive? Are these really under our control? 
  - Infinite Jest: 
  
    > Are we choosing what to love carefully enough ?
  
    > "Generation too afraid to say what it meant, and so in danger of fretting it had anything to say. 
  
    > Suddenly, for Wallace, sincerity was a virtue and saying what you meant a calling.
  
    > "One of the points of Infinite Jets is that the center is empty" (inside Hal there's pretty much nothing at all, he knows)
  
  - This is water
  
    > The trick is keeping the truth up front in daily conscious"
  
    > Learning how to think really means being aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to **choose** how you construct meaning from experience
