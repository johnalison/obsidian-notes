# Conscious (Annaka Harris)

- Had very high expectations, but was disappointed...
  Almost all quotes from other people about stuff I had already heard.

- Our experience of consciousness is so intrinsic to who we are that we rarely notice that something mysterious is going on.

- This book is devoted to shaking up our everyday assumptions about the world we live in.
  Some facts are so important and so counter-intuitive that we need to recall them again and again, until they finally permeate our thinking.

- What is consciousness for ?

- WE seem to be left without answers to the two questions with which we began this investigation:
  When we look closely we cant find reliable external evidence of consciousness.
  No can we conclusively point to any specific function it serves.
