# The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself  (Sean Carroll)

Book Ive been waiting for for a while. Describes emergence of complexity, life,  consciousness and our place in the univerise all from a naturalistic point of view.  Light on scientific details, but very good descriptions of effective theories and emergence at different levels of description.  Highlight was the descrption (program) of a robot that picks up beer cans that can only see locally and has no memory.
