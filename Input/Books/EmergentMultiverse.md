- To paraphrase John Bell (1987: 166), all measurements of the system are ultimately measurements of the macroscopic degrees of freedom (any measurement whose results are not ultimately represented in these degrees of freedom will not actually be usable by human experimentalists) so it suffices to give a theory of measurement for these degrees of freedom—which we can do by specifying a phase-space POVM on H  macro, or (somewhat less elegantly) by specifying a position measurement.

- the purpose of scientific theories is not to predict the results of experiments: it is to describe, explain, and understand the world.
  And quantum mechanics—as described in the previous sections—fails to do this.

- In quantum physics as in the rest of science, what motivates physicists is the explanation of phenomena, microscopic or otherwise.

-  the consensus view in philosophy is now that instrumentalism is incoherent as a way to make sense of science. Not all serious philosophers of science are realists in the sense that they think that our best scientific theories are approximately true, but there is a consensus that the only way to understand a scientific theory is to understand it as offering a description of the world.

- Quantum cosmology motivated Everett’s original work in 1957; quantum cosmology remains a powerful argument for the Everett interpretation even amongst ‘hard-nosed’ physicists unmoved by more philosophical considerations.

- As David Deutsch has acerbically remarked (2010), if palaeontologists informed us that dinosaurs were such weird animals that the laws of logic don’t apply to them, or that ‘palaentology’ wasn’t really about dinosaurs at all but only about fossils, we’d have a hard time taking them seriously.

-  One of the notable things about discussing the interpretation of quantum mechanics with physicists and with philosophers is that it is the physicists who propose philosophically radical ways of interpreting a theory, and the philosophers who propose changing the physics.

-  this, in a nutshell, is what the Everett interpretation claims about macroscopic quantum superpositions: they are just states of the world in which more than one macroscopically definite thing is happening at once. Macroscopic superpositions do not describe indefiniteness, they describe multiplicity.

-  as physics has continually reminded us, and we inhabit only a very small part of it, and it will not do to claim that it is just ‘obvious’ that it is not in a superposition.

- The ‘Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics’ is just quantum mechanics itself, ‘interpreted’ the same way we have always interpreted scientific theories in the past: as modelling the world.

- The fact remains that, at present, there are no known ways of explaining the quantitative predictions of relativistic quantum theory other than Everett’s. The Everett interpretation is the only game in town.

- The moral is clear: our intuitions as to what is ‘unreasonable’ or ‘absurd’ were formed to aid our ancestors scratching a living on the savannahs of Africa, and the Universe is not obliged to conform to them.

-   In general, even in a theory with linear equations, like electromagnetism or quantum theory, adding together two states with certain structures might cause those structures to overlap and cancel out, so that the structure of the resultant state cannot just be read off from the structures of the components. Indeed, in both electromagnetism and quantum theory, the technical term for this ‘cancelling out’ is the same: interference. In general, however—and in particular in the case of the cat—there is no interference between the live-cat and dead-cat states, and so both lots of structure continue to be present.  The reason we can be confident of this is because of decoherence, which in general prevents the macroscopic degrees of freedom of quantum systems from interfering, and so guarantees that structures instantiated by the macroscopic degrees of freedom of quantum systems are not erased when those systems are in superpositions of macroscopically definite states.

- I don’t know of an experiment that distinguishes the theory that dinosaurs existed from the ‘theory’ that dinosaurs didn’t exist but the fossils are exactly the way they would have been if dinosaurs had existed.

- In any case, we see this sort of thing a lot in science. We can’t directly observe a dinosaur, or a quark, or a quasar, or the interior of the sun, but that doesn’t stop us taking them seriously.

    Sceptic: In most of those cases, it’s just happenstance that we can’t make the observation. If we were properly situated in space and time, we’d be able to.
    Author: Well, if we were properly situated in the multiverse, we’d be able to see other worlds.
    Sceptic: How can you know that?
    Author: My best theory of physics tells me so. How do you know that you’d be able to see dinosaurs or quasars if you were appropriately situated?


- Why do you keep on insisting that this is just ‘quantum mechanics, taken literally’?
    quantum-logic theories, the Copenhagen interpretation, operationalism, and the like dont count as ‘taking quantum mechanics literally’ in the sense of accepting that the mathematical structure of the quantum state directly represents the structure of physical reality, just as in classical physics.
