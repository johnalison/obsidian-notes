## Beyond Good and Evil
  - Wasn't doing it for me (Bailed halfway through)
  - Could tell (got the feeling) that it was interesting to the cognoscenti
  - But too much over my head.
  - "Christianity is Platonism for the people"
  - Critique of " I think therefore I am" a thought comes when it wants, not when I want it to.
  - It is not the worst things of which one is most ashamed.
  - He who attains his ideal by that very fact transcends it.
  - There are no moral phenomena, only moral interpretations of phenomena
  - To make someone interested in you: pretend to be embarrassed in their presence.
  - The will to overcome an emotion is ultimately the will of another emotion.
  - He who fights monsters should be careful he doesn't become one. When you gaze long into an abyss the abyss gazes into you.
  - Madness is rare in individuals, but in groups, parties, peoples it is the norm.
  - Ultimately one loves ones desires and not that which is desired.
