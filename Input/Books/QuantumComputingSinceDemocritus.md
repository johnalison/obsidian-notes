# Quantum Computing since Democritus (Scott Aaronson)

- Either practical quantum computers can be built, and the limits of the knowable are not what we thought they are; or they can’t be built, and the principles of quantum mechanics themselves need revision. ;
  or there’s a yet-undreamt method to simulate quantum mechanics efficiently using a conventional computer. All three of these possibilities sound like crackpot speculations, but at least one of them is right!

- A novel argument for “why” quantum mechanics should involve the
  specific rules it does: Whenever you don’t know everything there is
  to know about a physical system A, your ignorance must be fully
  explainable by positing correlations between A and some faraway
  system B, such that you *would* know everything there is to know about
  the combined system AB.
