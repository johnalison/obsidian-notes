# Electronics (A systems approach) (Neil Storey)

- Generally very good. Gets to advanced topics quickly.

- Some redundancy / unnecessary details / out of date

- Want signal to have low output resistance, load to have high input resistance

- Large variations in gain from active circuits (OpAmps) can be overcome by negative feedback. 

- MOSFETs require very small area of Si. Resistors use large area should be avoided where possible on (ICs)

- Power in CMOS determined by small current that flows when switching.

- Shift registers used to convert parallel words into stream of bits on single line "Serial data". Can be used "backwards" to generate parallel data from serial input.

- Although very large numbers of devises could be combined with in single chip, difficult to identify circuits that could be used in large numbers to justify development cost. Intel found a solution in 1971 with the programable microprocessor.
