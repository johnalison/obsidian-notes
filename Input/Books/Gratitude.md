# Gratitude (Oliver Sacks)

- 2nd time through. Quick read.  Interesting.

- I'm glad I'm not dead! sometimes bursts out of me what the weather is perfect.

- It is up to me now to chose how to live out the months that remains to me.
  I have to live in the richest, deepest, most productive way I can.

- There is not time for anything inessential.
