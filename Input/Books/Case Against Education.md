Very interesting overall. Changed the way I think about education. 

**Observation**: There is a huge positive correlation between education and pay. 

**Three possible explanations:** 
- **human capital**: eduction makes people better/more effective workers
- **signaling:** education shows employers who the better workers are 
- **correlation w/o causation:** better workers are the type of people who want get educated 
(Truth is likely some combination of all three.)

The big idea of the book is that [[Education is mostly signaling]]. In which case education is a good investment personally, but not societally.  It then follows that there ought to be less subsidies for education. 

[[Social justice objection to cutting education subsidies]]

[[Libertarianism implies a strong bias against taxpayer support for anything]] including education.
("Separation of state education and state")

[[Educations position in society is robust against technological advances]]

Education not just for "vocational training"
- "Learn how to think" 
- create well informed citizenry
- Arts/Humanities appritiation
Bottom line: There is little or no evidence for this in society even if we assume education is responsible for all of it.
