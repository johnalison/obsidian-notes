## My Journey to the Nuclear Brink (W. Perry)
  - Average overall. More of a memoir than anything.
  - During the Cuban missile crisis an American ICBM was launched. It was a routine test that no one thought to reschedule.
  - After missing a bid for a Govt. contract, start-up company went out and loaned their employees to other companies that had gotten the contract as a way to keep their talent in house.
  - "Megaton to Megawatts" project blended down Soviet uranium in old bombs for use in commercial power reactors in the US.
  - Upward progress in human violence and global political trends hopeful, but nuclear conflict could in blink be the ultimate reversal.
  - Our chief peril is poised nuclear doom, too far out of global public consciousness.
  - "Our problems are man-made, therefore, they can be solved by man" JFK
  - The problem is not how long it will take governments to reduce nukes to zero, but that governments now aren't moving at all. 
  - Key to constructive action to prevent nuclear weapons being used is education of the public.
