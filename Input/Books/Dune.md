Frank Herbert

Very entertaining. Actually a fast read. 

Like how the plot naturally lead to characters explaining to each other (and the audiance) what was going on. 

Great world building. 

A lot about how a religion gets started and the inevitable path it leads to violence

Probably wont read the other novels. 

Like [[Infinite Jest]] in that a lot of the main action happens offstage.
