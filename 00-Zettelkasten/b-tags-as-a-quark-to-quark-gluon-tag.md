In principle, the splitting templates should depend on the flavor of the jets being split, eg: g→bb splittings will be different from q→qg splittings. However the b-tag of the jet is a good proxy for the q vs g tag. eg: a merging step that combines two b-tagged jets is likely from g→bb a merging step that combine a b-tagged jet with a non-b-tag jet is like b→bg.
