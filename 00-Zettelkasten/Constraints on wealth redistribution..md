Wealth transfers are not the most effective way to reduce poverty, growth is. We should only redistribute wealth up to the point that it maximizes sustainable growth. This constraint limits both the amount and type of redistribution. We should give to promote growth. This redistribution should be properly considered an investment, not a handout. 

The levels of sacrifice advocated by pure Utilitarians (eg:Peter Singer) go too far; they harm sustainable growth for small short-term gains. We don't have to give away most of our wealth to help the very poor.



# Follow-ups
- Most of the government programs are not tying to promote growth as their primary goal.
