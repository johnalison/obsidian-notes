When combining limits from two different measurements, the naive combination -- which assumes the measurements are completely independent is given by

$$
\sigma_c = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\frac{1}{\sigma_1^2} + \frac{1}{\sigma_2^2}}} = \frac{\sigma_1\sigma_2}{\sqrt{\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2}}
$$
If $\sigma_1=\sigma_2$, 
$$
\sigma_c = \frac{\sigma^2}{\sqrt{2\sigma}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2}}
$$
