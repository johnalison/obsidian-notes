Insight gained from the direct approach of meditation -- ie: directly examining who or what you are -- can fundamentally change your perception of yourself and reality. 

This insight (or awakening) is the realization that [[Our Default Point of View]] is not who we really are. Instead, we see that, experientially, [[We are a point of view, not a separate thing]].

The insight often comes in three distinct steps: 
- The first is the basic recognition that you are not the narrative. Your emotions and thoughts are not you, they are separate things that you observe.  This is a negative realization, you are not what you thought you are.
- The second is the realization that you are the subjective presence; the perceiver, not the perceived.  This is a positive insight, you are the point of view, the stage on which things appear.  (The pure subjectivity is sometimes referred to as emptiness, non-objectivity)
- The third insight is that which perceives is not and cannot be independent of what is perceived. They are in a one-to-one correspondence.  (Often called non-dual, one is the negative space of the other) Ying-and-yang. You cannot have the background alone without the foreground.
