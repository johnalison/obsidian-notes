All jets in the event are clustered in the hemisphere mixing procedure. This includes any ISR or FSR jets.  FSR jets should be clustered in the hemispheres; they are part of the underlying g→bb process and are independent of the g→bb fragmentation in the other hemisphere. ISR jets on the other-hand are not part of either of the individual g→bb processes, and tend correlation the kinematics of the hemispheres.
