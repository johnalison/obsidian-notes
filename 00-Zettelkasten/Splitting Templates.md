The splitting templates parameterize the sub-jet kinematics subject to the constraint that the combined jet mass and energy are conserved. This is done in the frame of $p_\mu = (E, p_T, 0, 0)$

The subjets can then be described by 4 degrees-of-freedom: ($\theta_A$. zA, mA, mB).  Where subjet A is the subjet with higher $z = p \cdot \hat{p}_{combined}$. Theta_A is the angle between this jets direction and the direction of the combined jet.  The plane of the decay is a 5th DoF.  Apart from $\theta_A$ and zA, the 5 variable are not very correlated. So we can sample this same as a product of 2D x 1D x 1D x 1D randomly sampled variables. 

Note that randomly sampling from the splitting templates will change the combined jets mass (which is of course a function of its substructure.)
