The jet declustering algorithm allows for some discernment between ISR and FSR jets. FSR jets will be clustered with the b-jets first; the ISR jets should be clustered last. The jet-declustering algorithm can be configured to stop when the b-jets have been clustered, but before the ISR jets.  Then only the FSR-like clusterings are declustered from the splitting templates.
