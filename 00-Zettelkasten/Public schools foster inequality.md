For efficiency, states prescribe geographical school districts and then establishes monopolies within each district. Children are compelled to go to their assigned school. Each school will then depend on the values and the character of the people within each geographic area. Engaged, wealthy areas will attract more of the best teachers while the poorer areas will be stuck with the worse schools. 


# Follow-ups
- In free-market schooling children would tend to go to schools closer to where they lived, but wouldn't be compelled to.
