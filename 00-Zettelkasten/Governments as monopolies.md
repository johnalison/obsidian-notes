Can think of governments as a limit of anarchic systems with runaway vertical + horizontal monopolies. (security + arbitration + others... ) Any arguments against monopolies in the private sector apply to governments in general.

Governments will thus tend to be less efficient (more expensive and poorer quality) than the free market equivalents.
