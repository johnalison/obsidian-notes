Main benefit of education is to let employers know who the good potential workers are. 
Success in school signals intelligence, work ethic, and conformity. 

Evidence in favor of this view: 
- School teaches subjects that aren't useful to employers and fails to teach many that are.
- "sheepskin effect" most of the gains from education only come after having the diploma
- What is more effective at getting a good job:  Princeton education or a Princeton degree ? Not obvious as is:  What is more effective at surviving alone in the woods: survival training or a survival training certificate ?
- Students don't retail what they are taught.




# Follow-ups
- If education is mostly signaling, increasing everyones education has little or no benefit. ("arms race") 
- "Eduction is a good way to get a job but a poor way to learn how to do a good job.
   If everyone had a college degree, the result would not be great jobs for all, but runaway credential inflation"  - Bryan Caplan
