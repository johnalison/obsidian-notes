Most of the myth making apparatus (or cultural institutions) is captured by progressive ideology: journalism, academia, the arts, corporate HR departments, and most tech companies. Progressive myths much more plausible, compelling and more widely disseminated.  In addition, the character of progressive myths is particularly harmful to fabric of democracy: they prioritize identity as a member of an out group (minorities and women) in favor of the collective citizenry, undermine trust in society and institutions (racist police, rich not paying fair share, campus rape culture, .... ). 

Progressive myths are not the only myths undermining American democracy, just the most compelling.
