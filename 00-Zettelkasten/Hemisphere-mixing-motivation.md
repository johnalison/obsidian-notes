The idea of hemisphere mixing is motivated by the assumption that most of the four b-jet comes from an underlying 2→2 gluon splitting process with each gluon subsequently splitting to b anti-b pair.  The assumption that justifies the hemisphere mixing procedure is that the two g→bb splittings are independent and only depend on the underlying gluon kinematics.
