Use the Journal to focus your intention.
Focus on what you are doing and what matters and why. 
Use it as a way to practice writing and therefore thinking.

Your mind can be empty if you know that you have a system that reliably holds the information allowing for a peaceful mind with out worrying about other thoughts.
