We let the government do things that would clearly be unethical for a individual or private company to do. Unless there is some justification (or "Political Authority") for why the government is able to act in ways citizens or companies cannot, these actions are also unethical for the government to do. 

Huemer points out in [[The Problem of Political Authority]] there is no such justification and therefore most of what the government does is unethical.
