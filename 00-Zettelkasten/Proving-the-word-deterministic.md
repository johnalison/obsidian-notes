How could you prove the world was deterministic?

You could
 - explicitly demonstrate it in simple sub-systems
 - Show that the laws (theory) predict the outcome
 - Then assume that the theory applies to more complicated systems

Seems like you have to prove that a theory is deterministic and then claim that the theory applies to the world.


   - determinism is the statement that initial conditions predict all future behaviour
