Reframe problems or setback -- especially unexpected setbacks -- as challenges of your character. This can turn a negative situation into a positive opportunity to test yourself. It is worth the time and energy designing a plan to avoid getting upset from unexpected (and inevitable) setbacks. 

Two parts of the challenge:  
1) Can you plan effective workarounds ?
2) Can you avoid getting caught in negative emotions?

Grade yourself on both of these aspects
1) How well did you search for workarounds  / consider options / 2nd order effect / pick the best option
2) (Much more important) How was your emotional response ?
