Americas major achievement was the implementation of mechanisms to limit government power: 
- Leaders chosen by popular election
- Written constitution limiting the government powers
- Separation of powers


However each of these mechanisms has flaws.
- Weak incentives for individual voters implies the system is fragile to corruption from special interest groups. (Tragedy of the commons)
- The Government itself must police violations of the constitution. 
	(Almost all federal laws, programs, and agencies are clearly unconstitutional)
- The different branches of the government can (and do!) gain more by working together to increase their power than by fighting to restrain each other.
