An algorithm to explicitly do jet clustering and declustering motivated by the hemisphere mixing technique. Use a jet clustering algorithm (kT/CA anti-kT) to do the clustering.  Paramaterize the clustering by low (1 or 2) dimension splitting templates. Randomly sample the splitting templates to generate new synthetic substructure. (Sampling preserves the pT and eta of the combined jet by construction) .
