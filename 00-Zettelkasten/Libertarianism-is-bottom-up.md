Libertarianism is a bottom-up approach to organizing society. This is the natural way to organizing a society if 1) top-down planning is intractable or in-principle impossible or 2) if individuals have a more right to choose what they do.  Notice that the assumption of Free-Will is a sufficient, but not a necessary, condition to single out libertarianism.

## Follow-ups
- [[Top down societal organization is impossible]]
- Morally required if individuals actually have free will.
