The $x^2 + y^2$ invariant implies the Euclidean coordinate transformation is in terms of cosines and sines. In relativity the invariant is $x^2 - t^2$. We can relate the coordinate transformation in relativity to that of Euclidean geometry by defining $t \equiv iT$.  The transformation of $x$ and $T$ will be simply sines and cosines like for $x$ and $y$, however when we substitute back $T \rightarrow -it$, we find that the transformation formula only makes sense if $\cos \theta$ is real and $\sin \theta$ is imaginary, or if $\theta$ is imaginary: $\theta = i \eta$ for $\eta$ real. We can then write the transformation in terms of $\sinh \eta$  and $\cosh \eta$.
