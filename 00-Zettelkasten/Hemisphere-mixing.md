Idea is to replace hemispheres (halves of events) with hemispheres from other events. Replace is done -- using a metric between hemisphere -- such that global event features are persevered, but the substructure within a hemisphere is scrambled: altered in a ~random way. 
The key is defining the metric such that the scrambling of the hemispheres preserves the average kinematics of the background which suppressing signal.
