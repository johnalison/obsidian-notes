Detaching, or shifting focus from the details of the current problem you're trying to solve to the larger perspective is a key leadership skill.  It can help clarify options and open alternative solutions. Detaching provides the space to be more rational and make better decisions.  


While detaching is good, its important to not be detached all the time.
