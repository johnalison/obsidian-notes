Libertarianism is a sensible strategy if you are not sure you know the correct course of action.  Freedom will foster of a diversify of potential solutions which will be more effective at finding a global (or better local) maximum. These decentralized solutions will also be more robust to [[BlackSwan]]s and unforeseen failure modes.


## Follow-ups
- This is almost always the case
- We don't know how to define the utility function.
- We cannot forsee [[BlackSwan]]s 
- We dont really know how to define good actions
