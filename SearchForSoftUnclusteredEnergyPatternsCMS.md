# Search for soft unclustered energy patterns in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV

https://cds.cern.ch/record/2887631?ln=en

-  soft unclustered energy patterns (SUEPs): characterized by a large multiplicity of low-momentum, diffuse, charged particles in the final state.

- The model that motivates this search [7] produces a high multiplicity of low-momentum, isotropically distributed particles, described as soft unclustered energy patterns (SUEPs)

- Events are required to pass a hadronic trigger with a threshold of HT > 900 (1050) GeV

- Why veto leptons ? Is the Associated production channel being analyzed?

- How efficient is the selection of the highest 2 pt jets  for SUEPs ?
   - What is the eff of the selection 74-77
