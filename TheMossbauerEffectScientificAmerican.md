- A good pendulum is the heart of a good clock, but it is not the clock itself.
  There must also be a device, such as a dial with hands, that counts the swings of the pendulum and thus allows us to read the time.
  We cannot directly count the oscillations of a vibrating nucleus.
  What we can do, however, is to compare with great accuracy the frequencies of two nuclear pendulums.

- The method is based on the familiar observation that sound waves from a vi­ brating piano-string induce resonant vi­ brations in another string, initially at rest but tuned to the same note.
  In the same manner gamma rays emitted by an os­ cillating nucleus are absorbed by another nucleus of the same kind, and set it into vibration. '
  When we observe this, we know that tIre two nuclei must have the same vibration rate, within very narrow limits of error.

- One starts with a radioactive source of the isotope cobalt 57, which is commercially avail­ able and has a convenient half-life of 280 days.
  As the cobalt-57 nuclei decay at this leisurely rate, they change into excited nuclei of iron 57.
  The iron nuclei vibrate at a frequency of 3 X 10)8 oscillations per second, with a half-life of 10-7 second (a 10th of a millionth of a second). Thus
  an iron-57 nucleus emits roughly 1e12 waves.

- The theory of nuclear resonance goes back several years, and, as we have re­ marked, the crucial experiment is a com­ paratively easy one.
  Why was it not done earlier?
  The reason is that certain secondary effects made it quite difficult to observe nuclear resonance before the work of Mossbauer.
