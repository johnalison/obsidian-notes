- In the MSSM, the higgsino and wino and bino fields, whose masses are characterized by the parameters mu, M_1, and M_2, undergo kinetic mixing as the result of the electroweak symmetry breaking, yielding charged and neutral mass eigenstates.
  In the case mu << M_1 and M_2, the lightest charged and two neutral higgsino-like eigenstates form a nearly mass-degenerate triplet of higgsino-like mass eigenstates (X_1^+/-, X_2^0 , X_1^0)collectively referred to as higgsinos in this Letter.
  In the pure higgsino limit where the bino and wino are decoupled in mass radiative corrections induce a small mass-splitting (250-400 MeV)  between  the higginos  that gives teh X_1^+/- a long enought lifefitme to produce the disappearing track signature in the detector, as exploited by existing searches.
