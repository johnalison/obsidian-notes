Sapiens:
  - The most important finding regarding happiness is that it doesn't not really depend on objective conditions of either wealth, health or community. Rather it depends on the correlation between objective conditions and subjective expectations.  Being satisfied with what you already have is far more important that getting more of what you want.
  - Repeated studies have found that there is a very close correlation between good marriages and high subjective well-being and between bad marriages and misery.
  - Happiness and miser play a role in evolution only to the extent that they encourage or discourage survival and reproduction.
  - There is only one historical development that has real significance. Today, when we finally realise that the keys to happiness are in the hands of our biochemical system, we can focus on the only thatn that can make us truly happy: manipulating our biochemistry. Prozac, for example, does not change regimes, but by raising serotonin levels it lifts people out of thier depression.
  - Money, scocial status, plastic surgery, beautiful houses, powerful positions - none of these will bring you happiness.  Lasting happiness comes only from serotonin, dopaminene oxytocin.
  - If we accept the biological approach to happiness, then history turns out to be of minor importance, since most historical events have had no impact on our biochemistry.
  - To be happy is no more and no less than experiencing pleasant bodily sensations.
  - A meaningful life can be extremely satisfying even in the midst of hardship, whereas a meaningless life is a terrible ordeal no matter how comfortable it is.
  - Although the people in all cultures and eras have felt the same types of pleasures and pains, the meaning they ascribed to their experiences has probably varied widely. If so, the history of happiness might have been far more turbulent than biologists imagine. Its a conclusion that does not necessarily favor modernity.
  - As far as we can tell, from a purely scientific viewpoint, human life has absolutely no meaning. Humans are the outcome of blind evolutionary processes that operate without goal or purpose. *Any* meaning that people ascribe to their lives is just a delusion.  Counter point: the beginning of infinity, science, humanity. 
  - Buddhism has assigned the question of happiness more importance than perhaps any other human creed. For 2500 years, Buddhists have systematically studied the essence and causes of happiness. Buddhism shares the basic insight of the biological approach, namely that happiness results from processing occurring within one's body, and not form events in the outside world.
  - If I want to experience pleasant feelings, I have to constantly chase them, while driving away the unpleasant feelings. Even if I succeed, I immediately have to start all over again, without ever getting any lasting reward for my troubles. According to Buddhism, the root of suffering is neither the feeling of pain nor of sadness nor even of meaninglessness. Rather the real root of suffering is th e never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant state of tension, restlessness and dissatisfaction. Due to this pursuit the mind in never satisfied. People are liberated from suffering not when they experience this or that fleeting pleasure, but rather when they understand the impermanent nature of all their feelings, and stop craving them. This is the aim of Buddhist meditation practices. When the pursuit stops, the mind becomes very relaxed, clear and satisfied.
  - This idea is so alien to modern liberal culture that when Western New Age movements encountered Buddhist insights, they translated them into liberal terms. "Happiness begins within" This is exactly what biologists argue, but more or less the opposite of what Buddha said. Buddha agreed with biology and New Age movements that happiness is independent of external conditions.  Yet his more important and far more profound insight was that true happiness is also independent of our inner feelings.
  - If Buddhism is right, our entire understanding of the history of happiness might be misguided. Maybe it isn't so important whether peoples expectations are fulfilled and whether they enjoy pleasant feelings. The main question is whether people know the truth about themselves.

- You cant become happy, you can only be happy.

- Dont wish for things to be a certian way. Wish them to be as they are. If you can do this- today, everyday - you will be happy. (See Amor Fati)

- Only way for long-term happiness is to live by our highest ideals. (Awaken the Giant)

# From Homo Deus
   - The glass ceiling of happiness is held in place by two stout pillars, one psychological, the other biological. On the psychological level, happiness depends on expectations rather than objective conditions. We dont become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence. Rather, we become satisfied with reality matches our expectations. 
  - Epicurus warned his disciples that immoderate pursuit of pleasure is likely to make them miserable rather than happy. Buddha had made an even more radical claim, teaching that the pursuit of pleasant sensations is in fact the very root of suffering. Such sensations are just ephemeral and meaningless vibrations. Even when we experience them we dont react to them with contentment: rather, we just crave more. No matter how many blissful or exciting sensations I experience, they will never satisfy me.
  - If I identify happiness with fleeting pleasant sensations, and crave to experience more and more of them, I have no choice but to pursue them constantly. When I finally get them, they quickly disappear, and because the mere memory of past pleasures will not satisfy me, I have to start all over again. Even if I continue this pursuit for decades, it will never bring me any lasting achievement; on the contrary, the more I crave these pleasant sensations, the more stressed and dissatisfied I become. To attain real happiness, humans need to slow down the pursuit of pleasant sensations, not accelerate it.
  - The Buddhist view of happiness has a lot in common with the biochemical view. The Buddha's suggestion was to reduce our craving for pleasant sensations, and not allow them to control our lives. According to the Buddha, we can train our minds to observe how all sensations constantly arise and pass away.  When the mind learns to see our sensations for what they are -- ephemeral and meaningless vibrations -- we loose interest in pursing them.

- If you want to make a man happy, add not to his riches, but take away from his desires.  -- epicurus

- Only metric of sucess: are you spending time doing things you like,  with people you enjoy, in a way that is sustainable. -- pMBA

- Epicurus says the fundamental obstacle to happiness is anxiety. No matter how rich and famous you are, wont be happy if you are anxious to be more rich/famous.
