# Extreme Ownership (Jocko Wilnick) 
  - There are no bad teams, only bad leaders
  - Leadership is the single greatest factor in any teams performance

  - This is simple, not easy: Be Honest. Show Integrity. Take ownership.
  - Start with micromanagement and morph into de-centralized command.
  - The worst thing you can do if you make a mistake is to avoid taking blame for it
  - Build Trust: Do what you say and say what you do.
