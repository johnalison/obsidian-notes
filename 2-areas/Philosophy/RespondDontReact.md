# Respond, don't React (Employ Stoic Test Strategy) 

- Anger/ Losing temper is never good, never improves the situation.

  > Always best to “observe” the anger, Reflect then respond. Response
    always superior to reaction. Reaction is the embodiment of anger

- “He who can compose himself is wiser than he who composes books” - Poor Richards Almanac: 
  
- Getting angry never makes things better.

  > To deal with stress need to get perspective (zoom way in or zoom
    way out). Return to the present moment. Accept the obstacle. (via
    Marcus Aurelius)

- Dont make things worse: When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging. 

  > Practically means that anger, action without plan (aka reaction)
  doesn't help, it hurts.  Remove emotion and make a plan (aka
  respond)

- Value time more than possessions. (Seneca)

- Be ruthless to things that dont matter.

- What is the thing you should be the most focused on ?

  > A: Staying calm/steadying your nerves.  Emotional, uncontrolled
    responses only ever make things worse.

### Stoic Test Strategy 

Set backs can be re-framed as challenges to test our strength of
character.  Re-framing turns negative situation into positive
opportunity to prove yourself worthy.  We control how we frame
situation we experience" Re-framing helps us control our Response,
allows up to be nice/decent to one another.  "We are bad men
living among bad men, one thing that can calm us down is to be
easy on each other" Worth spending time and energy developing a
plan to minimize emotional harm from unexpected (and inevitable)
setbacks.


 
- We are fundamentally a divided self: Mind vs Body.

  > Conscious (rational) vs unconscious/emotions (automate/base) Note:
  unconscious emotions are important. There is a lot that is easy at
  an intuitive level that is hard to rationalize ("gut
  feelings"). Often correct.  Can use mindfulness/BQ has a hack to tap
  into these ancient algorithms

- To succeed in a Stoic Test Challenge need
   1) plan effective workarounds 
   2) avoid getting caught in negative emotions. 

- **1st grade:** is how well I searched for a work-around. (Consider options ? / 2nd order thinking ? / Pick best option?)

- **2nd grade:** (much more important) what was my emotional response ?

- Can remove/silence/mute sub-conscious from loop by treating setback as *Stoic Test*. 
  > Prevents emotions from coming online. Lowers "cost" of setback. Improves change of success.

- Several different possible frames for setbacks

  > **Blame frame:** sub-conscious default mode

  > **Competing Obligations:** what would've had to be given up for me to get my way ?

  > **Incompetence frame:** mal-intent was not the aim, people involved are just simply incompetent

  > **Story-telling frame:** think of what a great story this will be when its over. Can also be an example just for yourself (or your journal!) of how to deal with setbacks

  > **Comedic Frame:** look at the humor in the situation. Think that you are part of a sit com. 

  > **Game/Stoic-Test Frames:** what the whole stoic test challenge is all about!

- Emotions are bad for handling setbacks

  > Shatter any tranquility we may have had.  Cloud our thinking on
    how to over come.

- 1st response to setback should always be to prevent the onset of negative emotions.

  > Negative emotions: unproductive and often do more harm than the setback

- Our brains are powerful computers but with arcane operating systems. 

   > Stoics hacked the system. Our tendency to blame setbacks on
      others and get mad at the situation can be
      shutdown/short-circuited. If we act quickly.

- Cast "have to" into "get to". 
  
  > There will always be a potential future position from which what
  you "have to do" now would seem like a dream come true.  When you
  are annoyed that there is something that you "have to" do. Image it
  as the luxury of the future self.

- Its OK to get mad, not to be angry. 
  
  > Getting mad is a reaction, instinctive, beyond control.  Becoming
    angry is a state of mind. Something that clouds later
    judgements. When mad make conscious decision not to get angry.

- Maintain Composure, Maintain Control

  > Things will go wrong. Thinkgs will not go as expected. Dont let
    chaos reign. Recognize the situation and detach. When you lose the
    beat, gather yourself and get back into the beat.


- Not manly to get angry. 

  > Not natural either. Better to be calm and controlled. Better to
    treat people with kindness. Dont go around expecting Plato's
    republic.  There are obstacles in the path ? Go around them. Why
    get angry ? Do you thing the world would notice ? or care ?

- Anger outlasts the Hurt and is counter productive

  > Learn how to let it go.  The best revenge is not to be that
    way. Learn what you can from the situation. Dont take it
    personally and move on.  Whatever happens couldnt be otherwise.

### Baltasar Gracian
   >  - The art of NOT getting into a passion: The first step to getting into a passion is to announce that you are in a passion.  It is great proof of wisdom to remain clear-sighted during paroxysms of rage. Every excess of passion is a digression from rational conduct. To keep control of passion one must hold firm the reins of attention.
   >  - Be Moderate: Moderation serves as a counter point to the impulses of passions (emotions) especially in sudden emergencies. Much thought is needed to prevent emotion from taking over. 
   >  - Never act from emotion: If you do all is lost. You cannot act for yourself if you are not yourself. Emotion/Passion drives out reason. You need to interpose a prudent go-between who keeps cool. As soon as you notice you are losing your temper, beat a wise retreat.

### Poor Richards Almanac
   >  - Whatever begins in anger, ends in shame.
   >  - The end of passion (emotion) is the beginning of repentance.

- Good designers never start by trying to solve the problem given to them.  They start by trying to understand what the real issues are.  (The design of everyday things)
