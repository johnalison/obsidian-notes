# Be the good: Intelligent ACTION is power

- To get what you want, deserve what you want - Charlie Munger

- “The great end of life is not knowledge, but action” - Thomas Huxley

- “Only thing that matters is doing the right thing right now. 
   > Past cannot be changed.
   > Future is not assured. 
   > The action in the present should be “right”.

- “The used key is always bright” - Poor Richard

- “Not enough to think or say the right things, you have to act on them” - Shane Parish

- Stop thinking about what a good person is/does and be one.

- "Can get substantial improvement by deciding to be a better person. 
   > Look around and see what traits you admire in others and then copy them. 
   > Can lead to lasting, significant improvement."  - Warren Buffet
   
- Want some good ?
   > Get it for yourself.  To have a good day, do good things.

- Ideology is viral, Pragmatism is functional.
  
  > Pragmatism is what needs to be embraced in order to do.  
  > Always look for the pragmatic over the Ideological.
  
- Today is the day, now is the time. This is when/how progress gets made. Live by doing. Do by focusing fully on the current task at hand.

- "Blow your own nose!" 

   > You can sit there praying your nose wont run or wait for someone
   > else to come along and wipe it.  Or you can blow your own nose,
   > that's what you have hands for.

- Do what is essential. 

   > “If you've been doing something for a while and it docent change
   > your life (ie: what you do/think/believe), Why are you doing it
   > ?...Go do push-ups" - Richard Heart Most of what we do or say is
   > not essential. If we can eliminate something that we do or say,
   > there will be more time/energy and tranquility to do what is
   > needed.  Always ask "Is this necessary? "

- “Whats the next action?” Philosophy seems to be practical/effective and clarifying.

- The Donts

  > Actions: Dont procrastinate

  > Conversations: Dont confuse

  > Thoughts: Dont wonder (focus)

  > Soul: Dont be Passive or Aggressive (moderation) 

  > Life: Dont be all about business (Not sure)

- Do the right thing because it is the right thing to do.

- If you can, do it now. (Seneca)

- "Do what nature demands of you. Get right to if its possible. Dont look around to see if people will know about it. Dont wait for perfection, be satisfied with any small progress, but push for more" Markus Aurelius

- Do not become trapped by idealism. 
  > Begin where the world is. Useless to delay action because things aren't perfect or the plan is not the best it could possibly be.

- Perfection is the enemy of action. 

- Real philosophers aren't concerned with authorship recognition, only with what actually works. 
  > What is said matters less than what is done.

   > - Most things are not obtained simply because they are not attempted


- Fools make feasts, wise men eat them (Poor Richards Almanac)

- Those who forget good and evil and seek only to know the facts are more likely to achieve good than those who view the world through the distortion of their own desires.

- Its often obvious what the right thing to do is, the problem is mainly one of discipline, not knowledge. 
    eg: eating right/exercising/sleep/being a dependable person

- Its not enough to have a good mind, the main thing is to use it well - Descarte
