- Bias Variance Trade off
- Lepton Fake Factor
- Closure Test
- Circle of Competencies
  > Understand/be aware of what you dont know and what you are not an expert it.
  > Probe to find where the limits of the "experts".
- First principles thinking
  > Exactly what physics trains for. 
  > Look for moving parts, knowns/unknowns and see how things fit together.  
  > Ignore the stories that you cant understand. 
  > Doubt everything that you cant get to from axioms.
- The map is not the territory
  > Understand the limits/inherent simplifications in the model.
  > Need different maps of the same territory to convey different relevant information.
  > Maps/models are tools, decisions should ultimately reflect the reality of the situation/territory.
  > Physics Examples: EFTs.
- Law of diminishing returns
  > Example of 80/20.
  > Get the low hanging fruit.
  > Acquire breath of knowledge at the 80/20 level. 
  > Then choose what long sloughs to fight. 
- 2nd order thinking
  > Consider the consequences of the consequences of your action.
  > Obviously want to think to as high an order as possible.
  > Developing trust is a great example (Be reliable ! See dont lie and be the good).
- Inversion 
  > "Invert, always invert" - Jacobi

  > Avoiding stupidity often easier than seeking brilliance

  > Index funds (Vanguard) can be seen as form on inversion
     > Easy to avoid poor returns 
     > Easy to lower known fees
     > Together these outperform almost everything

  > Inversion Steps: 
     > 1) Identify Problem, 
     > 2) Define Objective, 
     > 3) Identify forces that support change toward objective, 
     > 4) Identify forces that impede change toward objective, 
     > 5) Strategize. Add forces in 3) and remove from 4) 

  > Most people stop at 3), Inversion is all about finding problems that make things worse, and avoid doing them.

  > Ford bough scrapped Ford cars to find out wihch parts DIDNT fail.  Those could be made a lot cheaper. (Inversion) 

- Occams Razor (William of Ockham) 
- Hanlons Razor 
  > Most people doing wrong are not bad people trying to be malicious. 
  > Stupidity far more common than malice.

- Proving things about poly-nominals usual much easier than proving things about integers: Poly-Nominals have roots and can be differentiated. 
   (Is there a notion of differentiation that can be applied to integers? Primes? ) (Fearless Symmetry)

- Sturgeons Law: 90% of everything is crap. Look for the 10%.

- "Free roll" decisions with asymmetry between upside and downside b/c potential losses are insignificant.

- "Applause light" Saying something that is so trite that the reversal sounds abnormal, then the unreversed statement is not conveying new information.
