# Politics

- Power of thinking about diminishing returns not respected by enough democrats/liberals. Worth getting problems 90% solved; the extra 10% is often not worth the cost, politically

- Socialism for needs, Capitalism for wants. 

  > Especially now, critical to push hard on both of these.  Seems
    like the right has forgot the former, and the left has forgot the
    latter.

- Police Violence: 

  > Police should be allowed to use choke holds. Much safer than
    tasers (where head can hit ground) and much more effective if you
    know what your doing.

- Strange that the American libertarian 2nd Amendment "fire wall" types that are out to protect the constitution have aligned with the candidate that is the biggest threat to the democracy.

- How smart/plugged-in do you need to be to properly participate in democracy? And how do these requirements change with time?
  Claim: (Dan Carlin) the fraction of people that are informed enough to participate today is lower than anytime in the past.
