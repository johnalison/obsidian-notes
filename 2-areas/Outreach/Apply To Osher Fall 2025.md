Title:  
----------------------  
Particle Physics after the Discovery of the Higgs Boson : Are We Done ?  
  
  
Description:  
----------------------  
The Standard Model of particle physics is a spectacularly successful  
theory of the fundamental constituents of the Universe and their  
interactions. The discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron  
Collider is, on one hand, the final missing piece of the Standard  
Model and, on the other, a window into what lies beyond. In this  
lecture series we will discuss the Standard Model of particle physics  
and highlight the important role of the Higgs Boson in the theory.

# Biography:
John is a High-Energy Particle Physicist working on the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in Geneva Switzerland. He was part of the team that discovered the Higgs boson in 2012.  
  
John grew up in Pittsburgh; he graduated from Baldwin-Whitehall high-school and then studied physics and philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh. He went on to earn a Ph.d. in physics at the University of Pennsylvania and won several thesis awards for his dissertation on the discovery of the Higgs boson. John was then a fellow at UChicago, before joining the physics faculty at Carnegie Mellon in 2018.  
  
John is currently building particle detectors at CMU which will be installed at CERN for upgrade to the LHC. These detectors are all being built and tested in Pittsburgh, with local CMU students and engineers, before being sent to Geneva.
