# The Meaning of it All (Richard Feynman)

- Its not always a good idea to be too precise.

- To keep trying new solutions is the way to do everything

- Chlorophyll has a benzine ring, a square pattern of chemicals. Our systems in the blood, the hemoglobin have the same pattern of square rings. There is iron in the center instead of magnesium, so they are not green but red.

- If you look closely enough at anything, you will see that there is nothing more exciting than the truth.

- (About newspapers reporting that Faraday's discoveries are important for chrome plating) Electricity and Chemistry were suddenly discovered to be two aspects of the same thing -- chemical changes where the results of electrical forces. So to say merely that the principles are used in chrome plating is inexcusable.

- It was thought in the Middle ages that people simply make many observations and from them come to know the laws. But it doesn't work that way. It takes imagination, Where do the ideas come from ? It doesn't make any difference as long as they come. In science we are not interested in where an idea comes from. Their real origin is unknown; we call it the imagination of the human brain.
  (It is surprising that people do not believe in imagination in science, It is a very interesting kind of imagination, unlike that of the artist)

- It is interesting that human relationships, if there is an independent way of judging the truth, can become unargumentative.

- It is better to say something and not be sure than to say anything at all.

- To solve any problem that has not been solved before you have to leave the door to the unknown ajar. You have to permit for the possibility that you dont have it exactly right.

- I always live without knowing. That is easy. How you get to know is what I want to know.

- If you know that you are not sure, you have a chance to improve the situation.

- Believe in God and in science is thoroughly consistent, but it is difficult. Will discuss here why it is hard to attain consistency and whether it is worth it to try.

- Most awe inspiring experiences of nature (eg: contemplating the cosmos) is of such a kind that the church is inadequate to describe; the God of the church isn't big enough.

- If you dont have a good reason you have to have several reasons.

- Western civilization stands by two great heritages: spirit of scientific adventure and Christian ethics.  These heritages are logically consistent, but logic is not all. One needs ones heart to follow an idea.

- The US was developed under the idea that nobody knew how to make a government or how to govern. The result is that they invented a system to govern when you dont know how.

#PerfectionNotRequired

- We have plenty of time to solve problems, the only was that we will make a mistake is that we decide we already know the answer.

#PerfectionNotRequired

- No government has the right to decide on the truth of scientific principles, nor the character of questions investigated. Instead it has a duty to maintain the freedom, to let those citizens contribute to the further advancement  of the human race.

- To know if a man knows what he is talking about ask him intelligent questions -- penetrating, interested, honest, frank, direct questions on the subject, and no trick questions -- he should quickly get stuck, if he is an honest man.

- By honest I dont mean that you only tell whats true, but that you make clear the entire situation.

- How do you get new ideas? Mostly by analogy, but with analogy you often make very great errors.

- Who are the witch doctors today ? Psychoanalysts and psychiatrists.
