## Extreme Ownership (Jocko Wilnick) 
 - Very good
 - Overly wordy, but many good points
 - Extreme Ownership: 
 
   > requires looking at reality objectively. Without emotional attachment, agenda, or plans
 
   > requires leader to set aside ego/accept responsibility for failure
 
 - There are no bad teams, only bad leaders
 - Leadership is the single greatest factor in any teams performance
 - Ego clouds/disrupts everything (most difficult ego to deal with is your own) 
 - *Cover and Move*: "The most fundamental tactic, perhaps the only tactic"
 - "Relax, look around and make a call" (Detach)
 - For any team, it is essential to develop standardized planning process
 - *Commanders Intent* most important part of brief
 - Giving front-line troops ownership of even small piece of plan gets buy-in
 - Best teams employ constant analysis of tactics and measure effectiveness to adapt
   > Done through post-operational debrief. What went right ? wrong ? more effective ?
 - Paramount that senior leaders explain to jr leaders their role and how it fits the big picture
 - One of the most important jobs of any leader is to support your Boss. 
 - Factors for leadership (leading up and down the chain of command)
   > Take responsibility for everyone in your world: subordinates and superiors

   > If someone isn't doing what you want/need, determine what you can do to enable

   > Dont ask your lead what you should do, tell them what you are going to do
 - Dichotomy of Leadership (see 80/20 and diminishing returns)
   > Confident not cocky 
   
   > Leader and follower
   
   > Quiet not silent

   > competitive but gracious

   > humble not passive

   > calm not robotic 

   > attentive but not obsessed by detail

   > aggressive not over-bearing

   > Extreme Ownership vs Decentralized Command
 - This is simple, not easy: Be Honest. Show Integrity. Take ownership.
 - Dont do the leadership "comb-over"
 - Good performance comes from Rehearsal
 - When you (as a leader) have someone stepping up and taking charge and you start to feel intimidated. Ask: 
    > "Why am I intimidated by this situation? "

    > Its probably your ego. You are being a weak leader. 
 -  IF you have a weak leader: LUCKY YOU! 
    > Have an opportunity to take advantage and LEAD
    
    > Do what you want. Motivate yourself ! Take charge. Take advantage. 
 - Start with micromanagement and morph into de-centralized command.
 - The worst thing you can do if you make a mistake is to avoid taking blame for it
 - Build Trust: Do what you say and say what you do. 
 - When you are too embarrassed to ask for help: That's a little knock at the door saying "You're insecure!"
