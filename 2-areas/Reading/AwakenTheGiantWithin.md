# Awaken the Giant within (Tony Robbins)

- Average overall. Lots of duplication / useless examples.

- Our belief are like unquestioned commands, telling us how things are, what is possible and impossible.

- The best strategy in almost any case is to find a role model. Someone who's already getting the results you want and then tap into their knowledge. #RoleModels #MentalModels #Rationality

- Lots of people know what to do, but few actually do what they know. #BeTheGood

- Most people overestimate what they can do in a year, and underestimate what they can achieve in a decade.

- 3 decisions that shape your destiny: What to focus on. / What things mean to you. / What to do. #Questions #Checklists #MentalModels

- Success truly is the result of good judgment. Good judgment is the result of experience, and experience is the result of bad judgment. 

- Success is the result of making small decisions. 

- A real decision is measured by the fact that you've taken action. If there's no action, you haven't truly decided. #BeTheGood

- Stay committed to your decisions, but stay flexible in your approach. (Cultivate the art of flexibility)

- Become a hunter (aficionado) of excellence #Rationality

- Most important belief: In order to succeed and be happy we've got to be constantly improving the quality of our lives, constantly growing and expanding. #PerfectionNotRequired

- The only security in life comes from knowing that every single day you are improving yourself in some way. #PerfectionNotRequired #Rationality

- Q: What did I learn today ? What did I enjoy today? How did I contribute/improve? #Questions

- Its not enough to have a good mind, the main thing is to use it well - Descartes #BeTheGood

- 20% of any change is knowing how, 80% is knowing why. #Munger

- Emotion is created by motion.

- Q: What am I happy about now? What could I be happy about if I wanted to be? #Questions

- Model the habitual questions of people you respect. #RoleModels

- When angry: what can I learn from this so this never happens again? #Questions #MentalModels

- Words you habitually choose affect how you communicate with yourself and therefore what you experience.

- If you get upset, you loose control #RespondDontReact

- All perception of truth is a detection of an analogy.

- Emotions are like an internal compass which points to your goals.  #RespondDontReact

- Cultivate the appreciation for all emotions #RespondDontReact

- The direction were heading in is more important that individual results. #SystemsNotGoals

- Only way for long-term happiness is to live by our highest ideals. #Happiness

- Any difficulty in decision making ultimately comes from being unclear in our values. #SystemsNotGoals #Reliability

- Be more concerned about your character than your reputation. Character is what you really are, reputation is what others think you are #Reliability

- Only way to master your time is to organize your schedule each day to spend the majority of it doing things that are important. #SystemsNotGoals 

- Strive for balance, not perfection. #PerfectionNotRequired
