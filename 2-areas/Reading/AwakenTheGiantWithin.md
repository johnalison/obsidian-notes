- Success truly is the result of good judgment. Good judgment is the result of experience, and experience is the result of bad judgment. 

- Success is the result of making small decisions. 

- A real decision is measured by the fact that you've taken action. If there's no action, you haven't truly decided. #BeTheGood

- Stay committed to your decisions, but stay flexible in your approach. (Cultivate the art of flexibility)

- Become a hunter (aficionado) of excellence [[Rationality]]
