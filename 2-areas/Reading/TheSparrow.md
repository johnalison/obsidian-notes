## The Sparrow (Mary Doria Russell)

- Very entertaining.  A very religious book. Portrays the making of a saint.

- Dont pretend you arent feeling what you feel. That how things slide into hell. Feelings are facts. 

- Sometimes its enough to just act like less a shithead. #PerfectionNotRequired

- Not one sparrow can fall to the ground without your Father knowing it.
