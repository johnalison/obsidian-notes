# Death Be Not Proud (John Gunther)

- Average overall.  Quick read.

- A couple of nurses asked us with the deadly casualness that nurses have, "Is he your only child?"

- The trouble with science fiction is that its bad fiction and no science.

- Before every act -- ask yourself if that is what you want to do.

- Death always brings one suddenly face to face with life. Nothing, not even the birth of ones child, brings one so close to life as his death.

- Today, when I see parents impatient or tired or bored with their children, I which I could say to them, But they are alive, think of the wonder of that!  They may be a care and a burden, but think, they are alive! You can touch them -- what a miracle.
