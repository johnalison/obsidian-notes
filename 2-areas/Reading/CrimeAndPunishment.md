## Crime and Punishment
  - Overall entertaining, but I would say, not profound.
  - Probably missed a lot in between the lines.	
  - "Words are not deeds"
  - "Would not one tiny crime be wiped out by the thousands of good deeds?"
  - "We have to correct and direct nature, and but for that we should drown in an ocean of prejudice."
  - "If you would not do it yourself, there is no justice in it."
  - "Science now tells us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world relies on self-interest"
  - "In acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for myself, I am, so to speak, for all."
  - "Through error you come to the truth! I am a man b/c I err. You never reach truth without making 14 mistakes and very likely 114."
  - "To go wrong in ones own way is better than to go right in someone else"  (Not sure I agree...)
  - "I maintain that all great men... must by their very nature be criminals. Otherwise its hard for them to get out of the common rut"
  - "and your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing"
  - "Have you seen the butterfly round a candle ? Freedom  will lose its attractions"
  - "if one waits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long"
  - "if you convince a person logically that he has nothing to cry about, he'll stop crying." Response: "Life would be too easy if that were true"
  - "Nothing is harder than speaking the truth and nothing is easier than flattering. If there is a 1/100 part of false note in speaking the truth it leads to discord. But if all is false in flattery it is just as agreeable"
  - "The fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence"
