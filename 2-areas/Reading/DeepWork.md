# Deep Work  (Cal Newport)

- Fantastic!

- Deepwork: professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to the limit. These efforts create new value, improve skill and are hard to replicate.

- Our work culture shift toward the shallow is exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity for the few that recognize the potential of resisting this trend.

- The growing necessity of deep work is new. In an industrial economy most workers could do fine with out working without distraction. In the information economy, deep work is becoming a key currency. "Super power of the 21C" #NowIsDifferent

- "Deep work hypothesis" DW is becoming increasingly rare at the same time its becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. #Paradox

- Core abilities for future: Be able to quickly master hard things. Be able to produce at an elite level. Both quality and speed. 

- If you dont produce you wont thrive, no matter how skilled or talented you are.

- To learn hard things quickly you must focus intensely without distraction. #MentalModels

- When you switch tasks your attention doesn't immediately follow, there is a residual  that is stuck in the previous task.

- DW more valuable than ever before, yet not promoted by individuals or organizations. (#Paradox)

- Skillful management of attention is the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience. (#Buddhism) (#SystemsNotGoals)

- "Who you are, what you think, feel and do, what you love - is the sum of what you focus on"

- A workday driven by the shallow is likely to be draining and upsetting even if they seem harmless or fun in the moment.

- Most people assume that relaxation will make them happy. Our felling of going deep is in itself very rewarding.

- In the post enlightenment world we have tasked ourselves to identify whats meaningful and whats not, an exercise that can seem arbitrary and induce nihilism.

- The key to developing a DW habit is to add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the barrier to DW.

- People who use their minds to create value are rarely haphazard in their work habits.

- Focus on the WILDLY IMPORTANT: The more you try to do the less you actually accomplish.

- Act on the leading measures: you need to measure your success: Lagging vs Leading measures. Leading measures turn your attention to improving the behaviors you directly control that will have positive impact on long-term goals.

- Keep a compelling scoreboard: "People play differently when you keep score."

- Create a cadence of accountability: Use weekly review / celebrate good weeks / understand bad weeks.

- Shutdown at the end of work day: If need more time, extend workday. Downtime adds insights; unconscious mind well suited for complex tasks, integrating large amounts of information with multiple, vague and conflicting constraints.

- The work that evening downtime replaces is usually not that important.

- Decades of work from multiple subfields all point towards the conclusion that regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work.

- If every potential moment of boredom is relieve with a glance at a smart phone, then your brain has been rewired to point where it is not ready for deep work. #Boredom #DFW

- Schedule in advance when you will use the internet, then avoid outside these times.

- To simply wait and be bored has become a novel experience in modern times. (#Boredom)

- Put more thought into your leisure time.  Dedicate some advanced thinking to the question of how you want to spend your time "off".

- Mental facilities are capable of continuous hard activity; they do not tire like a arm or a leg. All they want is change - not rest, except in sleep.

- Treat shallow work with suspicion. b/c its damage often vastly underestimated and its importance is vastly over estimated.

- Stumbling on important insights are perfectly valid reasons to ignore schedules.

- Time blocking is about thoughtfulness, not constraint. Simple habit that focuses you to continually take a moment throughout your day to ask "what makes sense for me to do?"   The habit of asking is what returns results.
