## Breakfast of Champions (Kurt Vonnegut)
 - Didn't really get it. Was obviously a lot of cleaver stuff going on, most of it was over my head. 
 - "I thank those lusts (of gold and seeing little girls underpants) for being so ridiculous for they taught us that it was possible for a human being to believe anything"
 - "Ideas on earth were badges of friendship. Friends agreed with friends to express friendliness. Enemies disagreed with  enemies in order to express enmity."
 - "Seems like the only kind of job an American can get these days is committing suicide in some way"
 - I wont know myself until I find out whether life is serious or not"
