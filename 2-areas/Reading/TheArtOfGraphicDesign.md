# The Art of Graphic Design (Bradbury Thompson)

- Beautiful physical book. Not much real content.

- "A constant interest in work plus an interest in everyday things can give the artist and designer endless number of fresh ideas"

- "Beware the man of one book" -> This aphorism should be translated into Chinese.
