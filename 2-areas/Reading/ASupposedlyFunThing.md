# A Supposedly Fun Thing Ill Never Do Again (David Foster Wallace)

- My biggest tennis asset was a weird robotic detachment from whatever unfairness of wind and weather I couldnt plan for.

- Acceptance is its own verve.

- TV is all about desire, desire is the sugar in human food.

- TV-watching is different than Peeping-Tom-ism as the people being watched are not really ignorant of the fact that somebody is watching them.
  What we see is far from stolen, its a proffered illusion.
  
- TV is the way it is simply because b/c people tend to be extremely similar in their vulgar and dumb interests and wildly different in their refined aesthetic and noble interests.

  #WhoWeAre

- TVs greatest appeal is that it engages without demanding. One can rest while undergoing stimulation.

- Irony and ridicule are entertaining and effective and at the same time they are agents of great despair and stasis.
   Irony only has emergency use. Taken too far, it is the voice of the trapped who have come to enjoy their cage.
   Although entertaining, it serves almost an exclusively negative function, it is singularly un-useful in constructing anything to replace the hypocrisies it debunks. 

   #UnpopularTruth

- "Assholes are just assholes. Whats getting hot and bothered about it going to do about it except keep me from getting to have fun?"
