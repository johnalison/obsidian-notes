# How to decide (By Annie Duke)

- Average overall. Learned something, but much of it was at too low of a level.

- Only two things determine how your life turns out; luck and the quality of your decisions (You only have control over one of these) #Stoicism

- Unlikely to have a class on decision making until college or beyond. #ShouldTeachKids

- We dont even have a common language for talking about decision making.

- Using your "gut" to decide: Cant know whether you've "used" it properly, all you can see is the output.

- Where not good at recognizing when sacrificing quality in decision making isn't a big deal. #Rationality
   - "Knowing when the hammer is good enough is a meta skill worth developing"
   - "Knowing when its okay to save time is part of a good decision process"

- The quality of the outcome casts a shadow over our ability to see the quality of the decision. #MentalModels

- Making it a habit of asking yourself "If I where wrong, why would that be?"  #MentalModels #Rationality #Checklists
    helps to approach your own beliefs with more skepticism (Reduce systematic uncertainty)

- The happiness test: Will the outcome of your decision have any effect on happiness in a year? a month ? a year? #MentalModels #Rationality #Checklists
  If no, then you can speed up the decision with little cost.

- "Free roll" decisions with asymmetry between upside and downside b/c potential losses are insignificant. #MentalModels #Rationality #Checklists

- When a decision is hard that means its easy. The closeness of the options is what slowing you down. Actually this is a signal that you can go fast #MentalModels #Rationality #Checklists


- The lower the cost to quit, the faster you can go. Easier to unwind and choose something else. (Should think more in advance about option to quit) #MentalModels #Rationality #Checklists
 
- Decision stacking: Can you make lower impact, easier to quit decisions that will teach you something before the high-impact one-way decision (Rent before buy) #MentalModels #Rationality #Checklists

- "He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of that" - John Stuart Mill #MentalModels #Rationality
