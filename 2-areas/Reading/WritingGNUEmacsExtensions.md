# Writing GNU Emacs Extensions (Bob Glickstein)

- Learned a lot about how Emacs works behind the scenes.

- good practical example of how to write in lisp

- "Emacs users are in the happy position of being their own tool smiths"

- Emacs is really an editor builder -> General purpose interactive application builder.

- Real Emacs users create a universe of new tools.
