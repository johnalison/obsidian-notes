# The Ideas of Particle Physics (Coughlan, Dodd, and Gripaios)

- Three varieties of radiation result from the three main fundamental forces of nature effective within atoms.

- QM + SR makes it necessary to invent spin. (If electron spin had not been proposed and discovered experimentally, it would be been proposed theoretically.)

- In non-relativistic QM, g=2 is an experimental fact. With the Dirac equation it is a prediction.

- Anti-matter => that fundamental particles cannot be thought of as immutable fundamental entities. They can be created and destroyed.

- Four forces, only two relevant for most of the world.

- Intrinsic parity has meaning only because particles can be created or destroyed. If particles where conserved, then the product of intrinsic parities would always be the same.

  #Physics

- Can determine pion spin from p+ p->d + pi and pi + d -> p +

- Spin splitting from B-field is like mass splitting of isospin from charge.

- 1st massive accelerator experiment: In 25 days produced 10^14 nus and got 51 muons

- Kaons produced by strong interactions (ks or \bar{k}) but they decay as k_L or k_S

-  K_1 = (K + \bar(k)) (Up to normalization)
   K_2 = (K - \bar(k)) (Up to normalization) 

   K_L = K_2 + epsilon x K_1  and K_s = K_1 - epsilon x K_2

   epsilon is due to higher-order weak process => very small

- sigma(nu + e -> e + nu) = sigma_0 x (E_nu)/me   where sigma_0 ~ 10^-44 cm^2 ~ (10^-7 GeV^-1) ^2

- The reversion to the simplicity of the point-like scattering after a relatively more complicated transitional phase is taken to indicate that we have broken through to a new, more basic level of matter with in the nucleon.

- Deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering has been an extremely useful tool for probing the structure of hadrons.
  Learned:
	- the nucleon contains point-like constituents (partons), as evidenced by the approximate scale invariance of structure functions F(nu, q^2) = F(x)
	- partons have spin 1/2 is clear from the observed relation between the electromagnetic structure functions: 2F_1(x) = F_2(x)
	- behavior of the electro-weak cross sections strongly suggests the identification of these spin 1/2 partons with fractionally charged quarks
	- partons only account for about half of the nucleon momentum (at the energies that were originally probed)

- pi0 -> gamma gamma support for three colors. Calculation off by factor of 9 with only one color.

- Asymptotic freedom requires a non-Abelian interaction, <= 16 quarks, no Higgs breaking

- p158: nice explanation of pdf variation with q^2.

- Unusual lifetime of J/psi: preferred decay modes inhibited. Obvious J/psi -> D_0 + \bar{D_0} not possible b/c of D mass. More complicated (3 gluon) decay to non-charmed hadrons takes longer.

- Number of fundamental particles in SM:
   45 spin-1/2:
       15 * 3(families) = (1 nu (L-only) + 2 charged-leps (Land R) + 3(colors)*2(flavors)*2(helicities))x 3
   12 gauge bosons: (27 DoF)
       8 gluons + W+ W- Z + gamma
       8*2 + 3x3 + 2 = 27
   1 Higgs boson

- Question: How to think about anomalies in an EFT ?

- 19 Free parameters in the SM
   18 + 1 (theta QCD ~0) 
  Claim with nu mass now 27 + 1

    18: 9 masses + 3 coupling strengths + 4 quark mixing parameters (How to see 4?) + 2 EWK symmetry breaking (v and m_H)
