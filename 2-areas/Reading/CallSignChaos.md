- In drafting your intent, provide only what is necessary to achieve a clearly defined end state: tell your team the purpose of the operation, giving no more than the essential details of how you intend to achieve the mission, and then clearly state you goal or end state, one that enables what you intend to do next. Leave the "how" to your subordinates, who must be trained and rewarded for exercising initiative, taking advantage of opportunities and problems as they arise. #Leadership

- At the executive level, your job is to reward initiative in your junior officers and facilitate their success. When they make mistakes while doing their best to carry out your intent, stand by them. #Leadership
