# Call Sign Chaos (Jim Mattis)

- Good. Seems like parts are aimed at specific people. 

- Recruit for Attitude, Train for Skill

  #Leadership

- Two qualities I was taught to value most in selecting others for promotion was initiative and aggressiveness.

  #Leadership

- Marines assign an expanded reading lit to everyone promoted to a new rank.

- Competence is Key:  Be brilliant in the basics. Dont dabble in your job; you must mater it. #Reliability

- "Nobody caress how much you know, until they know how much you care" - Teddy Roosevelt #Quotes #BeTheGood

- Conviction: Your peers are the first to know what you will stand for and what you wont stand for. #Reliability

- If you as the commander define the mission as your responsibility, you have already failed. It was our mission, never my mission. #Leadership

- You dont control your subordinate commanders every move; you clearly state your intent and unleash their initiative. Then, when inevitable obstacles or challenge arise, with good feedback loops and relevant data displays, you hear about it and move to deal with the obstacle. #Leadership

- On the one hand, success was quantitatively measurable, on the other achieve those quantitative results depended upon qualitative skills that defied mere mathematical evaluation. #Paradox

- In drafting your intent, provide only what is necessary to achieve a clearly defined end state: tell your team the purpose of the operation, giving no more than the essential details of how you intend to achieve the mission, and then clearly state you goal or end state, one that enables what you intend to do next. Leave the "how" to your subordinates, who must be trained and rewarded for exercising initiative, taking advantage of opportunities and problems as they arise. #Leadership

- At the executive level, your job is to reward initiative in your junior officers and facilitate their success. When they make mistakes while doing their best to carry out your intent, stand by them. #Leadership

- Following WWII, our nations willingness to commit a 100 million dead Americans in a thermonuclear war to defend Europe was the single most self-sacrificial pledge in history. #History

- Re NATO: It is telling that an alliance designed originally  for the defense of Western Europe fought its first combat campaign in response to the 9/11 attacks on America. #History

- PowerPoint is an excellent way to display data; but it makes us stupid when applied to critical thinking. #Rationality

- George Washington's approach: listen, learn, and help, then lead. #Leadership

- Supporting a sectarian Iraqi prime minister (Maliki) and withdrawing all US troops were catastrophic decision. #Politics
  - The assessments of the intelligence community, our diplomats, and our military had been excluded from the decision-making circle.

- Its better to have friends with deep flaws than an adversary with enduring hostility. re: US foreign policy #Politics

- Nothing compensates for lack of trust.  Yet, its not enough to trust your people; you must be able to convey that trust in a manner that subordinates can sense. #Leadership

- B/c maverick thinkers are so important to an organization's adaptability, high-ranking leaders need to be assigned the job guiding and even protecting them, much as one would do for any endangered species. #UnpopularTruth  #Leadership
