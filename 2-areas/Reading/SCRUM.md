# SCRUM (Jeff Sutherland)

- Good book overall. Could have been a lot shorter. too many examples / too much bragging / I think the idea. Would be interesting to try to implement

- Only problem with Gantt charts: they are always wrong.

- Gantt charts used to plan WWI (developed just prior)

- Main idea: Whenever you start a project why not regularly check in to see if heading in the right direction/is actually what people want.

- 80% of the value of any piece of software in 20% of the features. #MentalModels

- People > process / Products that work > documenting specs / Collaborating > negotiating / responding to change > following a plan

- Three daily questions: What did you do since last meeting ? What are you going to do next ? What is getting in your way ?

- That very large groups do LESS seems to be an iron clad rule of human nature.

- Changing TEAM performance much more important (by orders of magnitude) than changing individual performance. #Rationality #Leadership

- Dont look for bad people, look for bad systems - one that incentivize bad behaviors and reward poor performance #Rationality

- Time makes up your life, wasting it is a form of suicide. 

- A team that depends on regular heroic actions to make its deadlines is not working the way it should.

- Normal Project Management Planning is stupid because people are so bad at predicting how much work something requires.

- Key to refine they plan THROUGHOUT they project, rather than do it all up front.

- What is the little improvement that can be done right away that will make things better?

- He who will defend everything, defends nothing.
