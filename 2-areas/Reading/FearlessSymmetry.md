## Fearless Symmetry
  - Not bad.  Good attempt to explain cutting edge math.
  - Tough going in the end, probably could have been done better.
  - Mathematical definitions create usage, not describe it.
  - Mathematical definitions cannot be wrong, only inconsistent or useless.
  - Lie group theory a marriage between calculus and group theory
  - Complex numbers forced on the world when solving CUBIC equiations. (Assumed x^2 + 1 = 0 had no solutions) Intermediate steps of the cubic equation involve imaginary numbers even though the final solutions are real.
  - Every root of a complex equation is already in C.
  - "2x3xR=C" the bible,  ie "pi = 3" the bible.
  - There is no (cannot be) a general method for finding all integer solutions to all systems of Z-equations in many variables
  - Pi is not in Q-Alg, this fact is apparently very hard to prove.
  - Not every number in Q-Alg can be obtained from the integers with repeated application of +,-,*,/ and ()^(1/n).
  - There is only one element of G (The absolute Galois Group) other than the identity which we can give a complete discription: complex conjugation.
  - A representation that is not faithful emphasizes certiant features of the sourse group and obscures others, enabling us to better understand the source group.
  - Some very large and complicated groups have been shown to be isomorphic to the Galois group of a poly-nominal (Including the Monster group)
  - Open conjectures: Poincare, Riemann Hypothesis, P==NP
  - Proving things about poly-nominals usual much easier than proving things about integers: Poly-Nominals have roots and can be differentiated.
    (Is there a notion of differentiation that can be applied to integers? Primes? )
