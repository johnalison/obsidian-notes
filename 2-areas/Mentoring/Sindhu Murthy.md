# Logs

## [[26 February 2025 Wednesday]]
- Has presentation re:double peak structure... 
- Will iterate

## [[19 February 2025 Wednesday]]
- Lots of DB work
- Will look into m4j structure

## [[6 January 2025 Monday]]
- Did a lot of Database stuff
- back on the double peak question
- Chatted a bit about motivation in for the lab (104)

## [[12 December 2024 Thursday]]
-  Long chat re:Annual review

## [[11 December 2024 Wednesday]]
- Annual Review
- [[Sindhu Murthy Annual Review 2024]]

## [[9 December 2024 Monday]]
-  Chat on mHH binning
- Will send slides for annual review tonight...

## [[5 December 2024 Thursday]]
- Long discussion of runTwoStageClosure

## [[4 December 2024 Wednesday]]
- [x] Chat re:slides for annual review
- Discussion of next steps...
- Near term plan:
	- Extend mass rage to 200 - 1200 
	- Separate closure tests in mixed data ZZ ZH and HH regions
	- Do fit in unblinded ZZ SR
	- Present background modeling in B2G
- Longer-term / In parallel :
	- Get signal samples picos
	- Do fit in blinded HH SR
	- Get limits vs mass
	- Plot SvB in HH SR
	- Determine if can gain with a SvB cut
	- Present in B2G (Determine publication plan)

	- Kick-off Valentina


## [[18 November 2024 Monday]]
- debugging mixed inputs

## [[4 November 2024 Monday]]
- Chat re:runTwoStageClosure
- Still needs to make plots on v4j...

## [[30 September 2024 Monday]]
- Discussed Tmux and jobs running out of memory
- How to save plots with iPlot
	- Still not directly making the plots that solve the problem!!!!
- Wants to transition away from DB/Labview work.

## [[24 September 2024 Tuesday]]
- Discussed ARC slides https://indico.cern.ch/event/1336564/contributions/5626178/attachments/2737511/4760888/ARCMeeting_13Oct23.pdf
	and walked through systematics. 

- Think she gets it now.

- Also talked through analysis endgame. Pointed her to ATLAS search:
	[https://www.arxiv.org/abs/1804.06174](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/1804.06174)


## [[16 September 2024 Monday]]
- Will start looking into systematics. 
- Will try to understand what is going on with the sculpting of the m4j.
- Not showing too much initiative.


## [[9 September 2024 Monday]]
- Added labels to plots. 
- Merged m4j hists for the separte regions into the central code
	- Hasnt looked into it yet.
- Some minor technical questions 
- Chat about DB issues. 
	- fix as much as we can on the back end.


## [[26 August 2024 Monday]]
- Discussed plan at [[4b Resonant Search]]


## [[19 August 2024 Monday]]
- Last time got code running.
- Adding separate plots for mHH

## [[12 August 2024 Monday]]
- Walked her through code
- Sent her:
	[[PythonVirtualEnvironment]]
- Seems like she was loading the code though ssh... fixed when doing a local checkout
- I showed her how I do it on my machine. 
- Walked her through next steps for X->hh->4b

## [[5 August 2024 Monday]]
- Had a nice time at the summer school. 
- Recommends the lectures

## [[19 July 2024 Friday]]
- Bias in 2d mass plane after plotting upper tail. 
	- edges biased ?
- Plot lower tail.
- How important is it to cluster in the mass mass plane after a DvB cut ?
