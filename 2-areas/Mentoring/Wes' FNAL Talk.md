# Another Iteration [[31 March 2025 Monday]]
- muon pt on the event display
- s8 would start first with DM
- then add ν with next slide
- s11 add the leptons to the z* decay
	- Say that the dM sets the scale of the lepton pT
- s16 keep the larger legend on the right
- s24 emphasis how important this is. low pt electron fake modeling!
- s32 say that this is show this next week at Moriond for first time!
- s32 add another slide that adds on the ATLAS figure for comparison

# Practice Talk [[28 March 2025 Friday]]
- Start 3:05
- Kill 1st level of bullet points! / Check spacing on slides / Color theme
- Add B-tagging work 
- Try to speak more loudly / Add Dynamic Range
- Put top quark FNAL 
- s5 bullet galaxy?
- s6 gill the bottom plot / "wimp miracle"
- s8 would do DM first ... Then add the ν line
- s9 easiest -> obvious 
- s10 point out: (explain a bit more) red  is neutrinos + jets
- s11 one scale sets multiple mass anoother scale sets the splitting
- s12 walk through plot on the right (Hard to read))
- s13 looks like other layers are there as well
- s14 not sure if you need the mll details. highlightthat this is the final var
- s15: hard to read /... point out gain mass splitting reach (PUT ON SLIDES)
- Dont say "a little bit"
- s18: again highlight the reduction in background
- s19 Event display: remind them of the "obvous seach" and then point out your extension
- s21: point out the gray is the most important part (CANT get form simulation)
- s23 does is not have the SF applied ? Maybe used post fit.
- s24 and s25 Walk through the plots gain. 
- s26 Talk though: before and after / 
- s27 skip 
- Analysis was about 20 mins
- s29 talk about CMU building the modules
- s30 27_000 sesons
- s34 give some Big Picture conclusions about the irradiated modules. 
- s35 10 min

# round 1 [[22 March 2025 Saturday]]
- Clean up the format: remove the red borders (Read:https://cmu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CMU_INST/1feg4j8/alma991010814439704436 ) 
- Add intro slide with outline and brief bio: when you joined CMS what you worked on and when you moved to CERN ect. 
- s1: Would add slide about the SM and how it has been so successful
- s2: Then can introduce DM as a big missing piece
	- The figure on left is more Dark Energy than DM. I would put another experimental evidence plot
- s3: Reccomend a thoeory slide on WiMPs instead of DM directly
	- (BTW: what are teh non-collider constraints on Higgsino and Wino-Bino models?)
- s6 Title: Searching for Dark Matter at teh LHC
- s7 Should check if there is a more recent version of this analysis
- s8; Should know what the blob on teh left is.  (How was this sercher for before LHC?)
- s9: Too much text.  Show in pictures examples of multiplets (know what sets M and ΔM)
- s11 too much text. 
- s18 too much text. Show Z* decaying to leptons.  Trick! -> Hard!
- s19 too much text. You should say this.. not write it 
- s20: again you dont need the text. Give example of cuts to define Fake-enriched region
		(better slide spacing/layout)
- s21(better slide spacing/layout) (Maybe combine 20-21)
- s22: why MC so far off ?
- I would but 25 and 26 in backup
- s27: make a version of this that shows
	- the lep limit, old SOS + disappearing tracks, then 
	- the lep limite, new SOS + disappearing tracks, then
	- the lep limit, new SOS + dis. tracks + isolated soft track. 
	- explain the analyses in picture: eg s89 -95 here: https://cms-mgt-conferences.web.cern.ch/conferences/pres_display.aspx?cid=3612&pid=27647 
- kill s28
- s31;  Add slides
	- Discuss MAC produciton at CMU.  
	- Then describe the Silicon lab at CERN 
	- Then explain you went to cern and worked in SI lab. and outline what you did there.
	- Then go on to 32
