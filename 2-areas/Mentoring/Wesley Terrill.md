# Weekly Meetings 

## [[18 March 2025 Tuesday]]
- Gave practice talk for approval 
- Chat re:money plot... He should make before/after version for FNAL talk
- [[Wesley Terrill Thesis]]
- [x] Find rules for showing public results in job talks: 
- https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/PhysicsApprovals#Exceptions_to_standard_approval
- https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/CMSPubComm

## [[11 March 2025 Tuesday]] (Virtual)
- SOS: We are pushing to freeze the documentation for approval but with only Higgsino and one of the TChiWZ scenarios (mN2*mN1<0). I found an empty background bin for the other TChiWZ scenario and the limits are being rerun with the negative scenario binning. The documentation has all been updated and a message sent to the conveners and ARC.  
  
- HGCAL: I am waiting on comments from people on the paper draft. We finally heard back about the cooling unit and it doesn't seem likely that it will be repaired before I leave. Otherwise, I created directions and tried them out on someone else for the measurement system so new measurements can be taken after I am gone.  
  
- Fermilab: I have a draft of the research seminar slides (missing a few plots that I was waiting on for results and interpretations as they are rapidly being updated). I am still working on the outreach talk (10min "outreach talk should not mimic a talk you would give in a public outreach event; instead, it is an opportunity for you to describe your outreach experiences, your outreach philosophy, and your ideas on how you might perform outreach as a Lederman Fellow." ).

- Defense: I would like to send out a poll for a date in April.

## [[26 November 2024 Tuesday]]
- SUSY-SOS Analysis:  
	- I was able to produce some preliminary fits with the full reweighting procedure (BR + mll). I am waiting on a few fits that I resubmitted to htcondor. But the limits look pretty good (except where any mass points are missing).
	- We wanted to give an update presentation to the conveners on all material answering the last questions and the J/psi reweighting but it has been pushed back to next week because of some conflict on their end.  Hopefully some approval on the J/psi veto will be given such that the final binning can be derived for everything (including the mll reweighting).
- HGCAL:
	- I performed a few injection scans at different temperatures on a non-irradiated HD module. I noticed a small dependence on the temperature for the ADC to fC conversion but I am still looking into how large of an effect this will have on the CCE measurements. Maybe applying uncertainties is enough to cover the dependence.
	- I also noticed during these scans, some issues with the calibrations in some channels that are not consistent between measurements (spikes in the conversion factor). Other than these few channels (<10 channels), the conversion factor looks relatively stable (the same) across all channels on the module.  
- Exo Workshop Talk:
	- I met with the analyzers of EXO-24-017 (the boosted ditau search) and discussed their analysis in a bit more detail with them. Although they could not say what the run3 plans are for their search other than that someone will likely perform it. They also pointed me to more presentations on the topic than the conveners were able to send.
Annual Review:
- I am almost finished with an initial draft that I can send you. 
- Set date for Dec 10th (9-10a EST)
Thesis:
- I am also done writing the first full draft of the document. I currently have some placeholder figures for things like CR/SR plots where I would like to eventually replace them with the final post-fit versions. Similar status for the interpretations as well.
