- 4 top seed at 5Ïƒ: ~ 4fb 
- No 3-top search: 2 fb (tttW dominates !)
- BSM can give 3tops: 
- Production involves b in the initial state
- Single Lepton / Same sign and Multi-lepton

SSDL/ML: 
- Nb >= 1   Why not >=3 ? what does Nb look like?

Questions: 
- How much 4top background is there?
- How is this fit ?
- What is the Acc x efficiency ?
