# AN v5

- L 726: Why not 3 or more ? to kill ttbar
- Would be good to quote the the signal Acc x efficiency for the SL selection, for the different signals. 

Questions: 
- "Validation of the data and Monte Carlo agreement for the DNN discriminator score is done in a completely orthogonal phase space to the signal extraction region." What the the score look like the validation region vs the extraction region ?

SS and ML:
- 769. 3 or more leptons, the event is vetoed if all three leptons have the same charge
	- Do you use these events to check the charge mis-id?
	
- Would be good to have total RunII histograms, split by year is nice to have, but also good to see the modeling with higher stats.
- L840: "If good agreement is found in the ttZ control region, we can demonstrate that the BDT used for signal extraction isn’t over-trained and/or displaying odd behaviors."
	- Can give a plot comparing the background BDT distributions in the ttZ to the SR ? How similar are they ? Do the most sensitive BDT bins in the SR have reasonably statistics in the ttZ CR ?

Skipping: 6.1- 





# Paper Draft
v0
L2 why not mention 3t + b as well?
L9: Why would observation of 3T confirm the observatino of 4T ?

not ready for prime time!

- 4 top seed at 5σ: ~ 4fb 
- No 3-top search: 2 fb (tttW dominates !)
- BSM can give 3tops: 
- Production involves b in the initial state
- Single Lepton / Same sign and Multi-lepton
- Forward jets ? 

SSDL/ML: 
- Nb >= 1   Why not >=3 ? what does Nb look like?
- 90% of the sensitivity 

SL: 
- does the ABCDnn use the XY regions ?
- ~10%


Questions: 
- [x] How much 4top background is there?
- [x] How is this fit ?
- [ ] What is the Acc x efficiency ?
- [ ] Which uncertainties are the most important: Stat vs syst? leading sys?
