- running all clustering functions on **cmslpc329**
- update **make_jet_splitting_PDFs.py** to automatically plot all splittings with some rought logic as to which histograms to use
- Failure of test script...Seems like data not available at LPC
```bash
OSError: XRootD error: [ERROR] Operation expired                                 
in file root://cmseos.fnal.gov//store/user/algomez/XX4b/20231115/data2018D/picoAOD.root
```
- `> xrdcp root://cmseos.fnal.gov//store/user/algomez/XX4b/20231115/data2018D/picoAOD.root .` fails 
- So does `eosls /store/user/algomez/XX4b/20231115/data2018D/`
