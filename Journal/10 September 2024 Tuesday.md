# Start fast!

# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- Debugging cutflow.  Input events are the same.  Some of the declustered Jet Pts are different.
- wrote helper function to output debug info
- All of the input pt are the same!!
- All of the clustered pts are the same!!
- Maybe the splittings are not ordered ?
- The declustered jet pt are Different!
