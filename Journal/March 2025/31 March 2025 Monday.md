# Log

up at 7

M&T to school ... H with me

Moving forward on Jim

# Taught
- Probability and Wave function 
- Chance found my mug !

# setup
- print french press return label
- draft mail for Jim Picard
- mail to Marina
- Mail to Seth Eisenberg re:investing

# [[Run3 Synthetic Data]]
- Starting to bootstrap average uncertainty 
- Script compute average and do bootstrapping:
	- `python jet_clustering/bootstrap_correlation.py output/synthetic_dataset_analyze_all/synthetic_data_Run3_v8_new_16seeds_SvB_values.coffea `
- Got the average of and the variance in a bin on SvB 
- Got a list of SvB values by event id
- [x] add weights... do bootstrap
- [x] make some plots

# [[Run3 HH4b Cutflow Challenge]]
- Marina's cutflow is off
	- requested events/run list
	- [>>] Compare Events

# Hoops / Steamroom
- 4s and 5s (2nd court)
- Good passing, good D, nice breaks, and some shots 
- 10' at Tmax = 124

# Manfred get Lazarus Award !!!
- put your people first 
- Really Enjoyed the feeling of someone else winning !  (Girard: "easy when not a rival" )

More Bootstrap study

Sent Picard offer letter

# Colloq 
- HEP for AI Yoni Kahn
- Theorist : known for methods to detect light DM
- Hard Problem 1: How do we understand training?
- Hard Problem 2: Where do scaling laws come from ?
- Hard Problem 3: How to quantify uncertianty 
- Claim: We are very far from how learning works in the brain
- Going to Ensemlble over models
- Learning as a phase transition
- Deeper is better up to a point ... Surely f(data, problem) ?
- Average at best

Walk to Cyert... Walk home


Some [[Myth of the Rational Voter]]

# [[Wes' FNAL Talk]]
- muon pt on the event display
- s8 would start first with DM
- then add Î½ with next slide
- s11 add the leptons to the z* decay
	- Say that the dM sets the scale of the lepton pT
- s16 keep the larger legend on the right
- s24 emphasis how important this is. low pt electron fake modeling!
- s32 say that this is show this next week at Moriond for first time!
- s32 add another slide that adds on the ATLAS figure for comparison


Late night Bootstrap studies
