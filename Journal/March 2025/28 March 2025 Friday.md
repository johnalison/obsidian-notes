# The ONE thing: 
- [x] Picards References

---
# To Do

- [x] Ping Picards references
- [x] Calculate spend rate vs budget
- [>>] Turnaround report
- [>>] Variance study of average SvB
- [>>] Understand changes in CMU CPI / UCSB CPI
- [x] Chat Manfred about giving me access to the CMU actuals 
- [x] Make 2D ratio plots (3 figures on the canvas !)

[[ProgressReport 28 March 2025]]

Looking into 2D plotting code

# Hoops 
- 5s / Great games .. Great Wins Great passing
- 10' at Tmax 124 / Heart rate max 109

# March Turnaround Report 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IiCxITzWZUyirePaRzgnm9W3zMwGhOonuUR_E0AJh9w/edit?gid=1108664677#gid=1108664677
([>>]) [[CAM Turnaround Report]]

# [[CMU 4b Chats]]
- AE: low pt plots
- SM: memory errors
- CL: not much 
- JA: new AN and synthetic data


# [[4b code base]]
- Working 2d plots 
- Merged the 2d and 1d helper functions
- Got the ratio going !!!

# [[Wes' FNAL Talk]]
- Start 3:05
- Kill 1st level of bullet points! / Check spacing on slides / Color theme
- Add B-tagging work 
- Try to speak more loudly / Add Dynamic Range
- Put top quark FNAL 
- s5 bullet galaxy?
- s6 gill the bottom plot / "wimp miracle"
- s8 would do DM first ... Then add the Î½ line
- s9 easiest -> obvious 
- s10 point out: (explain a bit more) red  is neutrinos + jets
- s11 one scale sets multiple mass anoother scale sets the splitting
- s12 walk through plot on the right (Hard to read))
- s13 looks like other layers are there as well
- s14 not sure if you need the mll details. highlightthat this is the final var
- s15: hard to read /... point out gain mass splitting reach (PUT ON SLIDES)
- Dont say "a little bit"
- s18: again highlight the reduction in background
- s19 Event display: remind them of the "obvous seach" and then point out your extension
- s21: point out the gray is the most important part (CANT get form simulation)
- s23 does is not have the SF applied ? Maybe used post fit.
- s24 and s25 Walk through the plots gain. 
- s26 Talk though: before and after / 
- s27 skip 
- Analysis was about 20 mins
- s29 talk about CMU building the modules
- s30 27_000 sesons
- s34 give some Big Picture conclusions about the irradiated modules. 
- s35 10 min

- Got kids... home ...
