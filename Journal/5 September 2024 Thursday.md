# The ONE thing: 
- [ ] Jet DeClustering


# To Do
[>] CAM Training
[>] Read HGC TDR
[>] Update skimmer CI: Compare cutflow during skim vs later processing vs known values
[>] Update printCutFlow to compare cutflows
[>] Add year option to plotting
[>] Push ttbar subtraction function

# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- Try dictionary the do floats.. fails.
- Might be able to do arrays ?  ... Nope
- Going to strings
- Implemented the propogation of btagging scores via strings
- Testing on **346**... ran**120m3.708s**
- Running analyzer
- TTbar subtraction for nominal
- bTag weights now look good... but dont make much of a difference.

Chat with Diana re:Lab tech ask from department
