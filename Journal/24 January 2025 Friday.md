Up at 6:50 

All ride to Cyert in the van

Work by 8:30 ... H with me today (No school b/c of sewer line)

# Taught
- Homework and general discussion

Field Trip Cancelled ... It was from ECS high-school!

# [[Change in ZH sensitivity]]
- Added the old SvB_MA to be made in parallel
- running histAll `source .ci-workflows/analysis-testAll-job.sh`
- converted (After adding SvB_MA_preUL* to the list of histograms to convert)
	- `python stats_analysis/convert_hist_to_json.py --input output/analysis_testAll_job/histAll.coffea`
- [ ] Need to check the acceptance of ZH in SR wrt c++
- C++ total yields: bothZH4b in 
	- ps: 61.91 (568,654 )
	- ps_zh: 49.15 (439,017)
- python (ZH4b only)
	- ps 35.85 + 20.5 
	- ps_zh: 28.48  +  16.0 
- [x] Run with ggZH4b
- on **cmslpc312** 

# Hoops
- 5s good runs ... Good passing
- Bunch of footballers there 

# 4b Chat
- SvB gains from adding other signal k_l points looks real but small. 
- Will check stat only... if promising compute systematics
- In parallel CL, will refit FvT x 15 kfolds.

H to Library with Owen

# CMU CMS
