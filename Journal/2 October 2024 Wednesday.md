M&T to school 

# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- make hists w/PS and hT RW

# Taught for Markus
- four-vectors + GR

# Hbb Meeting:
- Run 3 HH4b SPANET classification update (Matteo MalucchiÂ (ETH Zurich (CH)))
	- s7 why hight pT to break symmetry ?
	- s9 how to you define the eff?
	- s14: why not use extrapolated 2b for Bkg PDFs ? (Btagging enter the pairing probabilities ???)
	- s21: was seen in HIG-22-011 ! wrong pairs have a lot of SvsB separation
