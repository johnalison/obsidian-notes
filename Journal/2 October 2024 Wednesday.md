# The ONE thing: 
- [ ] [[Jet DeClustering]]


# To Do
- [ ] CAM Training
- [ ] Read HGC TDR
- [ ] Remake plottting to be more flexible re:hist structure ? 
- [ ] Ping Markus/Joe re:baseplates

M&T to school 

# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- make hists w/PS and hT RW.. not clear the RW does much
- update topReconstruction... merging
- Making another dataset (seed1)
- I think I finished this for now...

# Taught for Markus
- four-vectors + GR

# Hbb Meeting:
- Run 3 HH4b SPANET classification update (Matteo MalucchiÂ (ETH Zurich (CH)))
	- s7 why hight pT to break symmetry ?
	- s9 how to you define the eff?
	- s14: why not use extrapolated 2b for Bkg PDFs ? (Btagging enter the pairing probabilities ???)
	- s21: was seen in HIG-22-011 ! wrong pairs have a lot of SvsB separation 

# Hoops 
- 4s good runs
- Great passing / Poor shooting for me

# Starting to work mW constraint equations.
