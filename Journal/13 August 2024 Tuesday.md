# [[mixed2.0]]
- Declustering all on **cmslpc308** finished in **109m23.402s**
- Iterating on Slides 
- Idea for [[Recursive Splitting Types]]
- Implemented new splitting scheme... 
	- only 55 splitting types before groupings
	- after groupings got it down to 21
* Rerunning clustering with new splitting scheme
* Making new PDFs 00-07-00
* Running Declustering with new PDFs
	* Looks good
* Declustering signal on **cmslpc308** ... trying 2 workers
