# Will Start reviewing the quarterly plans
[[Summer 2024]]

Will be nice pairing to the progress reports


# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- cleaning code, push
- [ ] Verify new declustering on signal
- Automated the overwriting of auxiliary jet branches ... Needed for MC/data differences
- How to remove branches from skims? 
	- A: skip_branches in config
	- Can this be done dynamically ?  think so.
- Running the HH declustering ... failed b/c memory ? 
- Testing in tmux 335..out of memory... Retrying **cmslpc304** with 2 workers ... works **real    82m51.408s**
- save sumw2 from input metadata 
- What about trig weights? 

# Hoops
