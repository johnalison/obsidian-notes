# The ONE thing: 
- [x] Quarterly Planning 
- [ ] Jet Declustering


# To Do
- [ ] CAM Training
- [ ] Read HGC TDR
- [ ] Update skimmer CI: Compare cutflow during skim vs later processing vs known values
- [ ] Update printCutFlow to compare cutflows
- [ ] Add year option to plotting
- [x] Push ttbar subtraction function 
- [ ] Add synthetic dataset analyzer


# Log

Up at 7 

M&T to school ... work by 8:30

# Will Start reviewing the quarterly plans
[[Summer 2024]]
[[Fall 2024]]
Will be nice pairing to the progress reports


# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- cleaning code, pushed
- [ ] Verify new declustering on signal
- Automated the overwriting of auxiliary jet branches ... Needed for MC/data differences
- How to remove branches from skims? 
	- A: skip_branches in config
	- Can this be done dynamically ?  think so.
	- DONE
- Running the HH declustering ... failed b/c memory ? 
- Testing in tmux 335..out of memory... Retrying **cmslpc304** with 2 workers ... works **real    82m51.408s**
- save sumw2 from input metadata 
	- Done
- What about trig weights? 
	- Added trig weights to output file
- Need to propagate the btagging weights... Done
- Added CI for analyzing the synthetic datasets... Need to fix
- Making signal synthetic datasets on  **cmslpc304**... ran in **82m15.656s**


# Hoops 
- Played Great !!!
- Great Runs 3s and 4s

[[CMU 4b Chat 6 September 2024]]

More JetDeclustering

# CMU/CMS Round Table
- Not much


More JetDeclustering ... Nice progress

Home with M&T

Some [[Conspiracy]]

To Home Depot

Finished wrtting up [[BlackSwan]]

Late night hacking... got the CI going.
