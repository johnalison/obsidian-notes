# LEAK IN TEDDYS ROOM !
- Killed power
- Took fan down
- Called RickJon ... will come out tommorrw 

# Internet down !
- Needed to turn back on the power in Ts room
- eero down.... 
- Hour debugging... called eero support ... think the problem is b/c the router has the same wifi name as the eero.. was connecting to that instead. 
- Solved it by 
	- unplugging both the router and eero for 5 mins.
	- plugged in the router waited for stable internet connection
	- plugged in the eero
