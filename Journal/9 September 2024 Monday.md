# The ONE thing: 
- [ ] [[Jet DeClustering]]


# To Do
- [ ] CAM Training
- [ ] Read HGC TDR
- [ ] Update skimmer CI: Compare cutflow during skim vs later processing vs known values
- [ ] Update printCutFlow to compare cutflows
- [ ] Review Anikets slides For Thursday !

M&T to school ... H will stay home


# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- Make data presentation with outputs from new code
- Remaking data inputs on **cmslpc348**
- Start code for ttbar PSdata
- [x] Add cut flow CI test for analyze test
	- Problem with seeds in candidate jet selection

Looking into the Skimmer CI failing... Need to add more detailed checks...

# Gym / Steamroom
- core / 50' Zone 2 bike 
- 10' at Tmax  = 124

# Debugging Skimmer cutflow...
- Problem with counts (preSel now by tag)
- Problem with weights... Due to sumw not being the same in the skim... I think this is OK?

# Chat with Chris Berman re:PCA
- need to use both mean and variance to get PCA to work
