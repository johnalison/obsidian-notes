# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- Make data presentation with outputs from new code
- Remaking data inputs on **cmslpc348**
- Start code for ttbar PSdata
- [x] Add cut flow CI test for analyze test

Looking into the Skimmer CI failing... Need to add more detailed checks...

# Gym / Steamroom
- core / 50' Zone 2 bike 
- 10' at Tmax  = 124

# Debugging Skimmer cutflow...
- Problem with counts (preSel now by tag)
- Problem with weights... Due to sumw not being the same in the skim... I think this is OK?
