# Log

Up at 6:50 

M&T to school 

Car battery dead...

# Taught
- [[Relativity as based on a meta-physical law]]


# Debugging the synthetic data CI
- [x] Check input jets
- adding selJet and selJet_no_bRegCorr Kinematics
- Input jets are different ! 
- Adding debuggining to the make-synthetic-datasets job
- [ ] Need to read in yml files
