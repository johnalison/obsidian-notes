# Taught
- [[Relativity as based on a meta-physical law]]


# Debugging the synthetic data CI
- [x] Check input jets
- adding selJet and selJet_no_bRegCorr Kinematics
- Input jets are different ! 
- Adding debuggining to the make-synthetic-datasets job
- [ ] Need to read in yml files
- `python  analysis/debugMakeSyntheticEventsRun3.py output/synthetic_dataset_make_dataset_Run3/picoaod_datasets_declustered_test_2023_BPix.yml analysis/picoaod_datasets_declustered_test_2023_BPix_CI.yml`
- Problem is with Run3 jet calibration
-
