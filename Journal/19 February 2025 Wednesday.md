- [x] Remove synthetic data overrides
- Remake friend trees
	- `python runner.py -m metadata/datasets_HH4b.yml -c analysis/metadata/HH4b_classifier_inputs.yml -d synthetic_data -y UL16_preVFP UL16_postVFP UL17 UL18 -op output/ -o classifier_synthetic_data_v3.coffea`
- Copy output to eos **classifier_synthetic_data_v3**
