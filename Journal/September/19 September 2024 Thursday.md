# The ONE thing: 
- [ ] [[Jet DeClustering]]


# To Do
[>] CAM Training
[>] Read HGC TDR
[>] Update printCutFlow to compare cutflows
[>] Fine Tune histogram ranges (are the clustering hists affected... No!)
[<] Test FvT SB vs SB | ZZ | ZH

# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- Made nominal data (w/o TT) on **cmslpc343**
- Made nominal data wTT on **cmslpc343**
- [ ] ~~Script to make synthetic dataset yml (add PSDAta)~~
	- Will follow whats done with the mixed data instead
- [x] Script to make synthetirc datasets with different seeds
 [<] Make datasets with different seeds. 1/15
- Making Synthetic data set seed0 on **cmslpc343**
- Writing synthetic data output to EOS
- Adding SvB with out FvT weights for plotting.

# Faculty Meeting
- Fenguie and Antonella: all 3s

# MPL
- Muons on-shell
- Neutrons all good
- Mossbauer OK
- Some [[Jet DeClustering]] notes above

# Trigger weights now look good!
