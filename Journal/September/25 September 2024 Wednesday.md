# [[Jet DeClustering]]
-  Testing declustering time with fourTag data on **cmslpc340**.... had to turn off ttbar subtraction... with 10x lower chunksize
- clustering data (noTT subtraction) on 340... 112 m
- clustering with fourTag data ... crashed.
- clustering synthetic data... ran out of memory... running w/2 workers on **cmslpc342**... too long... trying 4 workers chunksize 10_000... looks like its working...works **107m59.205s**
- Cleaning up options for processors (factorized into helper function)... DONE
