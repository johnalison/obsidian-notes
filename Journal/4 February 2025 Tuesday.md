# Closure Test on Synthetic Data
- Following CL instructions here: https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-cmu/coffea4bees/-/tree/master/python/classifier#falconrogue
- on rogue01
	- `falcon`
	- `> ssh rogue01`
- Seeing Error with grid cert (Tried to use my userkeys and remake them... same)
	- `> voms-proxy-init -voms cms -rfc --valid 168:0
	Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
	Certificate validation error: Signature of a CRL corresponding to this certificates CA is invalid
	User credential is not valid!
- Works if I dont give the `-voms cms` 
- CL says above error only b/c Im outside the container
- container taking a while... I didnt hit enter !!
- proxy all good inside the container.
