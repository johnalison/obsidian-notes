# The ONE thing: 
- [ ] Cutflow challenge

---
# To Do

- [ ] Synthetic data
	- [ ] cut flow challenge !!!
	- [ ] Remake synthetirc data with update jet corrections
- [ ] Add Run3 job to CI
- [ ] Check effect of `selections.add( "pass4GenBJets", event.pass4GenBJets)`

# [[Run3 HH4b Cutflow Challenge]]
- output event list for florida
	- `python debug_HHRun3.py`
- Outputting our preSelection event list
	- `time python runner.py -o data_Run3_2022_EE.coffea -d data -p analysis/processors/processor_HH4b.py -y 2022_EE   -op hists -c analysis/metadata/HH4b_run_fastTopReco.yml -m metadata/datasets_HH4b_Run3_fourTag_v4.yml`
- [x] Ask Marina to compare unblinded inclusive 4b counts... Maybe normalization is CR acceptance difference 
- Made our event numbers list
- `python analysis/debugRun3CutFlow.py  hists/data_Run3_2022_EE.coffea`
- Only missing ~1% of events
- Some differences in jet and b-jet multiplicities
