# [[Run3 HH4b Cutflow Challenge]]
- Copied File from marina to 
	`root://cmseos.fnal.gov//store/user/jda102/debugRun3HH/data_2022_postEE_0_tree.root`

- Made the canvas site

# Aniket Oral 
- Presentation good
- Maybe more motivation for HH ?
- Suggest 1st present the big 3 then bbWW
- Why jet pt so low for signal ? 
- Plot sub-leading jet => 60% of signal
- More plots and less words ?
 Questions
 - s4: Lorentz Force: 
 - How are they accelerated ? Good
 - Synchrotron radiation:  losses small. 
 - frequency 400 MHz ?
 - Bremming: strength vs chemical species ? Z 
 - Why plastic is not good as plastic ?
 - Thickness of ECAL: charge on the nucleus
 - Why sqrt in S/sqrt(B) ?
 - What happens to 3 DoF of the Higgs
 - Why Higgs (v+h)^4 ??
 - How do you get anti-quarks at the LHC? PDFs 
 - E=mÎ³
 - Br(W->enu) ?
 - SC di-pole magnets 
 - How to focus the beams. 
 - Higgs potential factorization

# Gym / Steamroom
- core / 50' zone 2
- 10' Tmax = 123

# Chat Sindhu 
- Did a lot of Database stuff
- back on the double peak question
- Chatted a bit about motivation in for the lab (104)
