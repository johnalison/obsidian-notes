Some thoughts on Libertarianism:
- bottom up / Assumes top down is intractable
- Valide even if no free will. (given intractability)
- Sensible if you dont knwo the answer (could be fallible )

Is looking at things through the lens of not having free will useful?
- YEs for prison reform / Your attitudes toward others.
- Should try this. Does a habit/practice make sense in a world with/w/o free will ?
