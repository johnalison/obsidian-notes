# Log

Up at 6:50 

M & T to school

Finished [[Manfred Letter Spring 2024]]

Submitted Sams letters
[[Sam Hobbeheydar Rec Letter]]

# FBC2
- More evidence that Reclustering might be the way to go

# Taught 
- Lorentz Transformations

# Stats Chat
- How to calculate pvalues with SvB 

# Faculty Meeting
- Chat with the dean: No plan until March
- Think much of our problem is from the partitioning of the departments into MCS

Wrote [[ProgressReport 17 January 2025]]

# Office Hours
[[Modern Essentials]]
- [x] update TA office
- [x] Add Details of PATH
- [x] Review solutions 
- Look for problems


# Met Robert MacLachlan 
- Seems good. 
- $150k annual

# Chat Matteo
- Lots of good candidates
	- I think Should push for three
- Will give me a paragraph 


# Change in ZH sensitivity
- Fit with the old SvB
- For ZZ, ZH, and HH...
	- [ ] Compute acceptance in SR
	- [ ] Compute acceptance in VV-region
	- [ ] compare S/B ratios in bins of SvB
- Plots of the old SvB

AE sees gain in Âµ with new k-lambda SvB
- [ ] Need to debug

Home with kids.
