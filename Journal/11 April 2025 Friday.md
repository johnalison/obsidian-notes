# Teaching 
- Exam 3: (13 students in class) + Elise + Zoe + Robert + Angela Luo

Big fixing AEs replies.... not good

# [[Run3 HH4b Cutflow Challenge]]
- finding events... 
- Most (70%) missing the skimmer. 
- lxplus down...not down just slow
- Finding problem events... printing out the jet four vectors



# Christian Guito-Brody Accepts !!!!


Working [[Run3 HH4b Cutflow Challenge]] ... see above

Connecting to lxplus with [[Cursor]]
- `johnda@lxplus.cern.ch`

More setting up Cursor, got paragraph up/down working ! 

lxplus down...not down just slow

# STAMPS:  Malte Algren 
- "Density estimation of missing data using OT"
- PhD student in Geneva HEP
- Related to "In painting" problem in
- Setup the ABCD problem
- Crop out 4b SR replace removed events with 3b SR
- Fit OT from 3b -> 4b... Iterate
- How many steps ? .... How long for each step ? ... 
	- What do you technical  get in the end ? OT(map) 
- How do you deal with point clouds ? ... Use point clouds.
	- 16D â†’ 7D 
- How do you predict another variable ?
- Suggest adding 8th SvB variable and then comparing that prediction to the rewieghting
- Very Sensitive to the CR boundry
- Maybe start with a better infill assumption ... eg: the reweighted prediction
- Application generate synthetic data in the SR
