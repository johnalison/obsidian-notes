Up at 7 

M & T to school

# Taught
- GR in a day... Did not discuss redshifts

# L2 comments on [[Run2 HH4b AN]]
- Added the ZZ and ZH SR plots (Took them from HIG-22-011)
- Added Chuyuans updated classifier studies to appendix


Chat AE: 
- Setup tight muon ID 

# Hoops 
- 5s good runs. Good finishing and passing

More [[Run2 HH4b AN]] see above

# Writing up [[HGC Workshop Feb 2025]]
- [>>] are we using pre-series sensors for ROC 3b modules ?
