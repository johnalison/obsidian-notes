Setup

EOS down on LPC... joined LPC computing mattermost channel

# [[mixed2.0]]
- Cant run jobs... can do test jobs!
- Try to optimize with [[Numba]]... Not much improvement 
- Added a profiler to the test job... not clear where we can gain
- EOS back!
- Made PDFs for inclusive jet multiplicities: **jet-splitting-PDFs-00-04-00**
- Running all clustering to check detailed plots
- inclusive Declustering test job works !  with old 00-03-00 pdf
- inclusive Declustering w/ 00-04-00 pdfs  ... works fine
- inclusive declustering full 18 sample... 
- Bug when making inputs for 00-04-00 (random comb jet flavor order) ... remaking
