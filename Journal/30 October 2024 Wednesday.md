# [[Run3 Synthetic Data]]
- Trying with 3 workers ... Jobs failing b/c of memory 
- Try with 4 workers 10_000 chunksize ... looks like this is working... need to try condor
- Trying to run on condor submitting from **cmslpc313**
- Needed to add jet_clustering to transfered files... running... failed...
- Trying with chunk size 5_000, recopied voms-proxy... WORKED !!!... **175m51.908s**
- [ ] Need clean files from previous failed jobs



- [x] Migrate [[Classifier Studies]]

- [x] Migrate [[Run-3 4b skims]]

# HGC thoughts
- How big is the chiller ? .. .mail to Nural
- How expensive is the Alerdite ? How much do we save now that we do transfer tape  ... mail to Jessica
- How much is the transfer tape ?  ... mail to Jessica
- Notes: 
	- $30/cartridge 
	- With full epoxy can do ~10 modules / cartridge  ~ $3 / module
    - Hybrid can do ~30 modules / catrige ~ $1 / module
    - Susanna:  (SRP) quote 9000 pieces, enough for 4500 modules each at TTU and CMU. The cost per item does come down to $8.75 with such a large quantity.
- [ ] Ping Jeremy re: Baseline Change Request
	- Need spread sheet form Manfred...pinged him
