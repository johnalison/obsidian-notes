# MPL Recitation 

# School tests weaknesses. Life rewards strengths.
Spending more time on our weakest areas is tempting, but life mostly rewards us for investing in our strengths. Imagine a student who struggles with math but excels at writing. In school, they might spend hours raising their math grades from a C to a B. However, spending the same time on writing might move them from an A to an A+. Focusing on math makes sense when you're taught to think in grades. It doesn't make sense if you think about life. The difference between an A and an A+ in writing ability might mean the difference between a _New York Times_ bestseller read by millions and a book that only 100 people read.

Address weaknesses only to the point where they stop holding you back. Then concentrate effort on your strengths.  - [[BRAIN FOOD]]
