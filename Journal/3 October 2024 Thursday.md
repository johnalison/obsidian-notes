[[FBC2 Meeting 3 October 2024]]

# Working mW constraint
- finished... 
- [x] Write up
	- Done [[mW constraint]]
- Think I understand the weird masses (But why allways higher the mW ?)


# bbWW meeting

wrote up [[mW constraint]]

# HH4b chat w/L3
- useless

# Gym / Steamroom
- core / dips / calf raises / lunges 
- 10' at Tmax = 124
