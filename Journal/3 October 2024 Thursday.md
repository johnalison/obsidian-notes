# The ONE thing: 
- [x] mW Debugging
- [ ] [[Jet DeClustering]]


# To Do
- [x] Grade forward outlines
- [x] Look at LabTech applicants
- [ ] CAM Training
- [ ] Read HGC TDR
- [ ] Remake plottting to be more flexible re:hist structure ? 
- [ ] Ping Markus/Joe re:baseplates

M & T to school

Reviewing September
- [ ] Expand calculation in [[Ratio Errors]]

# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- Running on the 2 mixed samples
- v1 looks much better than v0... rerunning v0.
- v0 looks the same as before... making a v2
- v2 looks like v1.  Deleted v0 and remaking... updated seed as 53x(seed+13).. on **cmslpc321**

[[FBC2 Meeting 3 October 2024]]

# Working mW constraint
- finished... 
- [x] Write up
	- Done [[mW constraint]]
- Think I understand the weird masses (But why allways higher the mW ?)


# bbWW meeting

wrote up [[mW constraint]]

# HH4b chat w/L3
- useless

# Gym / Steamroom
- core / dips / calf raises / lunges 
- 10' at Tmax = 124

Looked at LabTech CVs but them on box here:
