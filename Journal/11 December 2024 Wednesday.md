# [[Run3 Synthetic Data]]
- [x] Fix CI
- [ ] Try Run-2 synthetic data with lower pt Cut
- Debugging CI
- Multijet cutflow OK .... but the histograms are off !?!
- Think the problem is with the tagcode
- If tagCode is buggy, the plots can be wrong, but the cutflow OK

[[4b code base]]
- [x] Dont draw ration points when no data

Fix ratio points with no data.
