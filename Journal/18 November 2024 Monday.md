# Debugging skimmer-analysis-cutflow-job
- `source .ci-workflows/run_local_ci.sh** **skimmer-analysis-cutflow-job`
- Running out of diskspace on ~/home
- moved `.apptainer -> /uscms/home/jda102/nobackup/.apptainer`
- Now running ! 
- job fails b/c missing Nano input file... 
- [ ] Download NANO locally and add to eos
- skimmer job now running. 
- Ran in HEAD Run3SyntheticData (**5d94291**) ... cutflow fails.
- Ran in origin master( **1ac47f3**) ... fails... but not by much 
- Trying in **2e0fad9** ... also fails by a little (should debug master)
# Hoops 
- 3/4/5s good games
