# The ONE thing: 
- [x] L2 Commnets
- [ ] HGC Estimate to complete

---
# To Do

- [ ] HGC Estimate to complete
	- [x] Read steves mail
- [ ] Did we arrange the pickup order
- [ ] More L2 Comments
- [ ] ROC plots for various signal points
- [ ] Maybe synthetic data with re-weight dR(close) vs dR(other) mass plane.
- [ ] Schedule FNAL badging appointment
- [ ] Hemisphere plots 
- [ ] Write up bootstraping study
- [ ] Make sum/SB/SR plots presentation

# Thinking about improving the synthetic data through reweighting
- Maybe synthetic data with re-weight dR(close) vs dR(other) mass plane.
- Try 1D distributions first ?

- From Steve's mail:
	- 2) Are the resource-loaded schedule and the estimate-to-complete up-to-date, accurate and credible?
	- 6) Has the risk analysis been updated to reflect the real risks of completing the project and are the contingencies acceptable?
