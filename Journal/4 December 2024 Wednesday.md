- [x] Chat re:slides for annual review
- Discussion of next steps...
- Near term plan:
	- Extend mass rage to 200 - 1200 
	- Separate closure tests in mixed data ZZ ZH and HH regions
	- Do fit in unblinded ZZ SR
	- Present background modeling in B2G
- Longer-term / In parallel :
	- Get signal samples picos
	- Do fit in blinded HH SR
	- Get limits vs mass
	- Plot SvB in HH SR
	- Determine if can gain with a SvB cut
	- Present in B2G (Determine publication plan)
