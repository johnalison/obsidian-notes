 Following up on signal crash when running all years (out of memory) during the synthetic datasets... 
- 2018 signal runs on OK ...  **cmslpc331** in **26m19.781s**
- Testing 2017 signal works .. Â **26m53.926s**
- Testing 2016 see ERROR on **UL16_preVFP** ... debugging
- Now all UL16 runs in  18m36.627s
- Running all signal samples together runs out of memory... trying with 3 workers...fails
	- Trying with 2 workers.. works !  **72m27.918s**
- Making the nominal signal for all years.. 
- data and signal all years looks good!
- Added CI to make the clustering histograms and the PDFs
- Found the slow down of the testing was do to all the pdf in 00-05-00 vs 00-03-00 !
