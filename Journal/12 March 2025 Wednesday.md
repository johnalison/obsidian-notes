Reciepts for [[Ann Arbor Trip 2025]]

Chat Able's  re:Ad and CVs from Allison Turner

Looks like the [[Boosted Synthetic Data]] is actually going to be harder than I thought
- Need to reclacluate m_regressed mass
- Need to recalculate PNet scores
- First try it with m-soft drop... Let Chance do it.

# Implementing Run3 selection
- From Marina: 
	- Code: https://gitlab.cern.ch/mkolosov/hh4b_run3/-/blob/run2/python/producers/hh4bTreeProducer.py?ref_type=heads
	- Config: https://gitlab.cern.ch/mkolosov/hh4b_run3/-/blob/run2/run/configs/2021/main/run3_2021_0L_PNet_MinDiag_Jets_4j35_2bj30_dHHjw30.yaml?ref_type=heads
- [x] Synch Lepton Definition
- [ ] Synch Higgs Candidate Selection
- Synched Electrons
- Synched Muons:


   - Testing with 
	   - `time python runner.py -t -o synthetic_data_Run3_2022_preEE.coffea -d data -p analysis/processors/processor_HH4b.py -y 2022_preEE   -op output/synthetic_dataset_analyze_all -c analysis/metadata/HH4b_run_fastTopReco.yml -m metadata/datasets_HH4b_Run3_fourTag_v6.yml`
