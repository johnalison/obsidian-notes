Reciepts for [[Ann Arbor Trip 2025]]

Chat Able's  re:Ad and CVs from Allison Turner

Looks like the [[Boosted Synthetic Data]] is actually going to be harder than I thought
- Need to reclacluate m_regressed mass
- Need to recalculate PNet scores
- First try it with m-soft drop... Let Chance do it.

# Implementing Run3 selection
- From Marina: 
	- Code: https://gitlab.cern.ch/mkolosov/hh4b_run3/-/blob/run2/python/producers/hh4bTreeProducer.py?ref_type=heads
	- Config: https://gitlab.cern.ch/mkolosov/hh4b_run3/-/blob/run2/run/configs/2021/main/run3_2021_0L_PNet_MinDiag_Jets_4j35_2bj30_dHHjw30.yaml?ref_type=heads
- [ ] Synch Lepton Definition
- [ ] Synch Higgs Candidate Selection


- Loose electrons are defined as:
	- pT > 15 GeV, |eta|<=2.5, el.pfRelIso03_all < 0.15, satisfying el.mvaIso_WP90 and
	- if abs(el.eta) < 1.479:
	- abs(dz) <= 0.1
	- abs(dxy) <= 0.05
- else:

- abs(dz) <= 0.2
- abs(dxy) <= 0.1

Loose muons are defined as:

- pT > 10 GeV, |eta| <= 2.4,Â  mu.pfRelIso04_all < 0.15, satisfying the mu.looseId and
- if abs(el.eta) < 1.479:

- abs(dz) <= 0.1
- abs(dxy) <= 0.05

- else:

- abs(dz) <= 0.2
- abs(dxy) <= 0.1
