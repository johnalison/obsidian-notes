# The ONE thing: 
- [ ] Setup  [[Boosted Synthetic Data]]

---
# To Do

- [x] Follow up on Institutional review
- [x] Another Look at L2 comments
- [ ] Fermilab Access
- [ ] Setup for Chance
	- [ ] Get him set up with [[Boosted Synthetic Data]]
- [ ]  Read for [[ARC TOP-24-006 3 top production]]
- [ ] Hemisphere plots

# Setting up [[Boosted Synthetic Data]]
- filter boosted fourvectors
- Setup on rogue
- Nanos failing on rucio... Nano not avilible on LPC, needed to add MIT
	- [[dasgoclient]]
- 

# Review [[Run2 HH4b AN]]
- need hemiplots and new data

# Thinking about bootstrapping to get statistical uncertainties on a histogram
- Toy data weights one.
- make histogram 
- fluctuate weights and compare RMS to sqrt(N)
- Toy mixed dataset, 
- histogram
- fluctuate weights compare RMS to sqrt(N)
