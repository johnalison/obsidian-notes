Ride to school with S

Curtis asked to be part of MCS planning committee. 

Get emacs setup on LPC


# Taught
- Double slit

`diskutil unmount force ~/RemoteServer`

# Getting remote emacs working:
- playing around with sshfs... not working
- Trying emacs TRAMP: 
`/ssh:jda102@cmslpc-el9.fnal.gov:/uscms/home/jda102/nobackup/HH4b/Run3/coffea4bees/`
- works great!!
