# The ONE thing: 
- [ ] [[Run3 Synthetic Data]]


# To Do
- [x] Mail re:LabTech interviews
- [x] [[Osher Fall Particle Physics Course]]
- [ ] Renew Visitor pass
- [ ] Ping Dean for lab visit
- [ ] Re-skim Run3
- [ ] [[Cluster Run 3 data]]

# [[Run3 Synthetic Data]]
- [x] Fix missing bRegCorr variables
- [x] Fix missing btagging
- Compared Run2 and Run3 plots... lots of differences... fixing
- [x] Selected Jets energy scale different
- [x]  update Run3 btagging to PNet
- [ ] Fix bReg corrections
- [ ] Re-skim
- Testing the Run3 synthetic dataset `python runner.py -s -p skimmer/processor/make_declustered_data_4b.py -c skimmer/metadata/declustering_for_test_noTTSubtraction.yml -y 2022_EE  -d data  -op output/synthetic_dataset_make_dataset -o picoaod_datasets_declustered_test_2022_EE.yml -m metadata/datasets_HH4b_Run3_fourTag.yml`
- Made clustering code agnostic of btagging algorithm
- Remaking Synthetic datasets on **cmslpc322**.. locally...**215m32.777s**

Â supervision is not a job of giving orders; it is a job of providing the opportunity for people to use their capabilities efficiently and effectively.

[[Lab Techs Fall 2024]]
- Sent mails

Did [[Osher Fall Particle Physics Course]] 
- v1
- [ ] Need to test AV (Wednesday Morning ?)


Wes gives Monday Meeting talk
- [x] Watch recording.
- ~600 m^2 Si and ~500 m^2 Scintillator  

# Hoops 
- good runs 5s 

Joe's slides [[HGC MAC P2UG Silicon Modules]]

More [[Run3 Synthetic Data]]

# Sindhu Chat
- Chat re:runTwoStageClosure
- Still needs to make plots on v4j...

Watching Wes' talk

Pick up M & T ... Home with kids.
