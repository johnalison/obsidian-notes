Yes, we follow the method used in HIG-20-005 ( [https://gitlab.cern.ch/mkolosov/hh4b_run3/-/blob/run2/python/producers/hh4bTreeProducer.py?ref_type=heads#L3350](https://gitlab.cern.ch/mkolosov/hh4b_run3/-/blob/run2/python/producers/hh4bTreeProducer.py?ref_type=heads#L3350) )  in which : 

if the difference of the minimum and second minimum distance from the diagonal is less than 30, we choose the pair that has the maximum H1 pT in the 4-jet center-of-mass frame.

# Wes Defense
- Wimp Miracle  ? What was miraculous about it?
- Flying misquote is about 7 TeV.
- Wedge shows more information that is actually there!
	- (How do we know the neutrino cant be dark matter ?)
- Why not taus?
- s26:  Actual conversions or effect of efficiency
- Shane on zoom? 
- Matt: 
	- Wimp Miracle, why cold dark matter. Top-down vs bottom-up
	- Small scales form first and then grow... wouldnt get that with neutrino dark matter.
	- Natural target for WIMPs
	- Direct detection experiments do they have an impact? 
- Valentina:  
	- How do we get fakes?...W + jets / Z + jets
	- in displaced DY + bjets 
	- How much do you gain from low pT
	- How did you optimize the ID ?
	- Why 10s of cms most interesting ?
	- Higgsino / Wino-Bino
- Manfred:
	- Comparison with ATLAS
	- What about conversions
	- How was binning optimized ?
	- HL LHC more data, but with more PU?  What changes ?
	- Module: What is the baseplate for ? Why PCB ? 
- Eva: 
	-  How to combined HGC with the analysis
	- Test structures vs Cells in the Modules.
	- Nice that they agree !
- John: 
	-
