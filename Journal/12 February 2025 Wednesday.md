M & T disasters in the morning.... Need to go to bed earlier

M & T to school 

# [[Jet DeClustering]]
Good idea last night (while in bed): 
- mass of the jets is not an invariant ! Depends on the jet pt 
- Should recompute the mass after transform back and have the pt
- Need new pt jet 

# Taught
- Relativistic Energy! 

Did some grading

# [[Synthetic Data Closure]]
- Trying to train again.. CL fixed the container
- Setup singularity ... reinstalled (good sign)
- `> singularity exec -B .:/srv --nv --pwd /srv docker://chuyuanliu/heptools:ml bash --init-file /entrypoint.sh`
- Now training runs great! 

# Chat AE re:L3 comments

# Hoops
- Highland ... Good runs 
- Played well but lost too many
