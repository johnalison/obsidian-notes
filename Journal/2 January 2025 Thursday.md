Marlos Bed arrives
# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- Plots for RunII 30 GeV 
	`py jet_clustering/compare_datasets.py hists/synthetic_data_RunII_30GeV_noOverride_seedXXX.coffea --out analysis/plots_synthetic_datasets_all_00-08-02-RunII_30GeV_noOverride -m analysis/metadata/plotsSyntheticVsData2.yml`
- Make slides
	`make jetclustering_slides_RunII TEXFILENAME=SyntheticDatasets-00-08-02_RunII_30GeV_noOverride NEW_DIR=analysis\\/plots_synthetic_datasets_all_00-08-02-RunII_30GeV_noOverride /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/make jetclustering_slides_year YEAR=RunII`


# Gym / Steamroom
- core / back squat / press / pull-ups
- Still cant do front squat b/c wrist
- 15' at Tmax = 118

Got $900 from Liberty Mutual

reviewed November

# Chat with Roy
- Recommends shrooms
- Who cares if P/E is high.. just means I will hold it for longer
	- Say is P/E ~ X, expect to earn 0.05 P => if E = 1/20 P, then P/E = 20
	- APPL:  E = 0.3 P so P/E ~ 3
