# Adding Run3CI 
- Analysis job and cut flow
- [x] Need to upload flies to eos
- Coping files to EOS
	- `py filesToLxplus.py `
- Failed...files there but cant be read on gitlab...pinged AE
- Had to explicity give alejandro access to the tmpFiles directory via CERNBOX
- that worked! ... merged! 
- Need to add cutflow
# Stats Chat
- [x] Send crypto links
	[[CryptoLinks]]
	[[CryptoBottomLine]]
- Another background fit in th eSR

- AE pushed fix for JECRs 
- pulled...fixed printout
- resumbitting on **cmslpc331**
- `source .ci-workflows/synthetic-dataset-make-dataset-all.sh`
- Finished ... **real    149m59.119s**
- Making hists... errror when processing synthetic data with new JECRs
- fixed... running
