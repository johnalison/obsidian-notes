# The ONE thing: 
- [x] Progress Report


# To Do
[>] Watch w-mass seminar
[>] CAM Training
[>] Read HGC TDR
[>] Update printCutFlow to compare cutflows
[>] Fine Tune histogram ranges
[>] Test FvT SB vs SB | ZZ | ZH
[>] ~~Chat Curtis re:MCS computing~~
[>]  [[Debug trigger weights]]


# Log

Up at 7. 

SMH still hammering away...

W-mass seminar: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1441575/

Finished [[ProgressReport 16 September 2024]]

# Gym / Steamroom
- Core / pull-ups / front squat / press
- 10' at Tmax = 124

[[Chat w Wes 17 September 2024]]

Trigger weights in python seems buggy.  Will debug wrt c++. 

AE to look into FvT Fits.

Pinged Nuno re:computing
- Will start being annoying here.
- Proceed here before going through Curtis

# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- [[Debugging PSdata]] code have three tag events in `-e UL16_postVFPÂ  -p ps_data_TTToHadronic`
  --> Solved. B/c of the MC jet calibration
 - Should replace jet four vector with calibrated fourvector in psdata
	 - Done
 - [x] Need to push

[[CMU HGC Mac Meeting 17 September 2024]]

# MPL
- Hematite look good!
- Muons doing fits
- Neutrons on track 
- Chat with Aniket: will try neutrino reweighting on W-mass constraint

# MCS Pride day
- hot dogs

Reading [[Nexus]] and [[Self-Help is like a vaccine]]
