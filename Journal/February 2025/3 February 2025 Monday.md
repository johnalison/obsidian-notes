# Taught 
- Muons at the surface of the earth
- Doppler effect

# Close on debug truth4b [[Add Cutflow Histograms]]
- See daily's above
- Maybe this is why the gaussian kernel failed before... YES! 

# Josh Arrives !!!

# Testing the Gaussian Kernel 
- Edit the processor by hand `self.gaussKernalMean = 600`
- ` python runner.py  -o signal_m600.coffea -d ZZ4b ZH4b ggZH4b GluGluToHHTo4B_cHHH1 -p analysis/processors/processor_HH4b.py -y UL18  -op output/analysis_test_job -m metadata/datasets_HH4b.yml`
- Gaussian Kernel filtering now makes sense !

# [[Synthetic Data Closure]]
- See logs above

# Hoops
- 5s good runs... Lots of wins
