# The ONE thing: 
- [ ] [[Debug trigger weights]]


# To Do
- [ ] Watch w-mass seminar
- [ ] CAM Training
- [ ] Read HGC TDR
- [ ] Update printCutFlow to compare cutflows
- [ ] Fine Tune histogram ranges
- [ ] Test FvT SB vs SB | ZZ | ZH
- [ ] [[Debug trigger weights]]

# [[Debug trigger weights]]


Watching w-mass:
- Subset of 2016 data 16.8/fb (pu = 30)
- Only use inner tracker to fit muon pt
- Only use muon pt to fit mW: (Different systematics have different shapes)
	- 3D fit pt/eta/charge
- Effectively Do with J/psi include local terms for Bfield distortion and material model
- Constrain theory uncertianties directly with W data
