# The ONE thing: 
- [x] [[Debug trigger weights]]
- [ ] [[Jet DeClustering]]



# To Do
- [ ] Watch w-mass seminar
- [ ] CAM Training
- [ ] Read HGC TDR
- [ ] Update printCutFlow to compare cutflows
- [ ] Fine Tune histogram ranges
- [ ] Test FvT SB vs SB | ZZ | ZH
- [x] [[Debug trigger weights]]

M&T to school

# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- Pushed sub-sampling working

# [[Debug trigger weights]]
- Fixed.  np.all(ht) < upper_bin -> ht < upper_bin

# Watching w-mass:
- Subset of 2016 data 16.8/fb (pu = 30)
- Only use inner tracker to fit muon pt
- Only use muon pt to fit mW: (Different systematics have different shapes)
	- 3D fit pt/eta/charge
- Effectively Do with J/psi include local terms for Bfield distortion and material model
- Constrain theory uncertianties directly with W data

# Hoops 
- Great runs / Great wins. 
- Played decent

Trigger weights still not well modeled.
