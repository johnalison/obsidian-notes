# The ONE thing: 
- [x] [[Debug trigger weights]]
- [ ] [[Jet DeClustering]]



# To Do
- [x] Watch w-mass seminar
[>] CAM Training
[>] Read HGC TDR
[>] Update printCutFlow to compare cutflows
[>] Fine Tune histogram ranges (are the clustering hists affected... No!)
[>] Test FvT SB vs SB | ZZ | ZH
- [x] [[Debug trigger weights]]

# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- Pushed sub-sampling working
- Remaking subsample... output on EOS... Done
- Testing all synthetic data + TT PSdata
- debugging running PS with isSynthetic flag...working
- Adding PS data to synthetic dataset via metadata file.
- Made synthetic datasets with and without PSData TT
- Making nominal data (w/o TT) on **cmslpc343**.... works 

# [[Debug trigger weights]]
- Fixed.  np.all(ht) < upper_bin -> ht < upper_bin

# Watching w-mass:
- Subset of 2016 data 16.8/fb (pu = 30)
- Only use inner tracker to fit muon pt
- Only use muon pt to fit mW: (Different systematics have different shapes)
	- 3D fit pt/eta/charge
- Effectively Do with J/psi include local terms for Bfield distortion and material model
- Constrain theory uncertianties directly with W data

# Hoops 
- Great runs / Great wins. 
- Played decent

# Trigger weights still not well modeled. 
 - Lots more debugging... weights actually seem OK to me.
 - Seems like false alarm (AE needs to remake the input friend trees)

# Si sensors arrived
- put them in the shipping area

Now jet declustering....(see above)
