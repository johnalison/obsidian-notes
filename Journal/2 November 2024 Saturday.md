# Farnam Street Wisdom
“People spend too much time on the last 24 hours and not enough time on the last 6,000 years.”
— Will Durant


If an opinion contrary to your own makes you angry, that is a sign that you are subconsciously aware of having no good reason for thinking as you do.
-- Bertrand Russell 

# There are different types of hard work:
1. Outthinking (a better strategy, a shortcut)  
2. Pure Effort (working longer, intensity)  
3. Opportunistic (positioning yourself to take advantage of change)  
4. Consistency (doing average things for longer)  
5. Focus (saying no to distractions)
Each of these requires a different type of hard work.
