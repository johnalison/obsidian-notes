- [ ] CAM Training
- [ ] Read HGC TDR
- [ ] Update printCutFlow to compare cutflows
- [ ] Fine Tune histogram ranges (are the clustering hists affected... No!)

# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- [x] Add year list option to plotting
	- [ ] Remake plottting to be more flexible re:hist structure ? 
	- [ ] PDF by year. Probably want an option of grouping them by year...
- [ ] Benchmark current status of synthetic data
	- Updated script to process new syn_vX running
	- Adding ttbar plots to the nominal background samples... running out of memory with "fast" reco... trying "slow".
		- (use histAll ? ... No doesnt have top_cands..) Maybe not worth it...

# HH4b chat
- Not much 
- Will implement Run-3 selection


# Chat with Chris Palmer
Discuss ideas for small author paper with CMU colleagues.  
  
Chris' (naive) paper idea:   

1. describe how many systematics cover banded systematic variation. 
2. Perhaps mention also a good example (e.g. background modeling with free parameters like in Hγγ). 
3. Make a toy that will fail to adequately cover truth with just a banded systematic.  
4. Show that basis will be able to recover the truth without biased signal strength.
    1. Somewhere need to describe orthogonalization of the basis. 
5. Show that many bases would do the same job. 
    1. Is the order of the basis dependent on the basis choice?
