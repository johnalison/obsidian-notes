# The ONE thing: 
- [ ] [[Jet DeClustering]]


# To Do
 [>] Ping Nunu et al
 [>] CAM Training
 [>] Read HGC TDR
 [>] Update printCutFlow to compare cutflows
 [>] Fine Tune histogram ranges (are the clustering hists affected... No!)

# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- [x] Add year list option to plotting
	[>] Remake plottting to be more flexible re:hist structure ? 
	[<] PDF by year. Probably want an option of grouping them by year...
- [x] Benchmark current status of synthetic data
	- Updated script to process new syn_vX running: 
		[[Script to compare synthetic and nominal datasets]]
	- Adding ttbar plots to the nominal background samples... running out of memory with "fast" reco... trying "slow".
		- (use histAll ? ... No doesnt have top_cands..) Maybe not worth it...

# HH4b chat
- Not much 
- Will implement Run-3 selection

Moved Chats with Sindhu and Aniket.

NAS for home ? 

# H to Walk-in Hours
- All good / Waste of time
- Pizza afterwords... good !

Starting to fine tune hist ranges...
