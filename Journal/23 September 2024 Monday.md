# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- [x] Add year list option to plotting
	- [ ] Remake plottting to be more flexible re:hist structure ? 
	- [ ] PDF by year. Probably want an option of grouping them by year...
- [ ] Benchmark current status of synthetic data
	- Updated script to process new syn_vX running
	- Adding ttbar plots to the nominal background samples... running out of memory with "fast" reco... trying "slow".
		- (use histAll ? ... No doesnt have top_cands..) Maybe not worth it...

# HH4b chat
