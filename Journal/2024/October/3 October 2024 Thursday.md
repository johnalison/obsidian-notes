# The ONE thing: 
- [x] mW Debugging
- [ ] [[Jet DeClustering]]


# To Do
- [x] Grade forward outlines
- [x] Look at LabTech applicants
 [>>] CAM Training
 [>>] Read HGC TDR
 [>>] Remake plottting to be more flexible re:hist structure ? 
 [>>] Ping Markus/Joe re:baseplates



# Log

Up at 7:15

M & T to school

Reviewing September
- [x] Expand calculation in [[Ratio Errors]]

# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- See daily logs above


[[FBC2 Meeting 3 October 2024]]

# Working mW constraint
- finished... 
- [x] Write up
	- Done [[mW constraint]]
- Think I understand the weird masses (But why always higher the mW ?)


# bbWW meeting

wrote up [[mW constraint]]

# HH4b chat w/L3
- useless

# Gym / Steamroom
- core / dips / calf raises / lunges 
- 10' at Tmax = 124

Looked at LabTech CVs put them on box here:

More [[Jet DeClustering]]... See above

# Late night debugging syn_v0.
... see above.
