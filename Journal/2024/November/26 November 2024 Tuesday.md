[[Inquiry for Module CT Scans Lumafield]]


# Lumafield Chat
- 4-6 hours to process a modules
- 75k / year use as much as you want
- Modules are probably too big to get the magnification to see ~100Âµm

[[HGCManagementMeeting 26 November 2024]]

# Andre Chat
- offered 32/hr
- Start date Feb 1
- will get back to me on Monday

# Start work on Matplotlib ".py"
- key is  https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-matplotlib/05-mplhep/index.html
- hist commands from: https://github.com/scikit-hep/hist/blob/main/src/hist/plot.py
- will make list of `(values, variances, edges, config)` for hists same for ratios
