Up at 7:30 

# Moved to L2 Review for Run2 HH->4b !

Read Wes' research statement

# Debug truth v4j
- Running the signal 
- `python runner.py  -o signal.coffea -d ZZ4b ZH4b ggZH4b GluGluToHHTo4B_cHHH1 -p analysis/processors/processor_HH4b.py -y UL18  -op output/analysis_test_job -m metadata/datasets_HH4b.yml`
- truth 4b there for ZZ and ZH....checking ZH
- Found that with out a cut on status Im getting more than 4 bjets
- Only the HH4b has the status in the genParticles ... need to rerun on nano
- ` python runner.py -t  -o signal.coffea -d ZZ4b ZH4b ggZH4b GluGluToHHTo4B_cHHH1  -p analysis/processors/processor_HH4b.py -y UL18  -op output/analysis_test_job -m metadata/datasets_HH4b.yml -c analysis/metadata/HH4b_nano.yml `
- Running on **cmslpc339**
