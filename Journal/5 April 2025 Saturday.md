Analogy between QM interpetations and free will 
- Everett is the global reality, but Copenhagen is the correct explanation/logical conclusion of observer that is part of the system. 
- Globally there is no free will (concept probably doesnt even make sense). But for an observer within the system it is a necessary requirement (otherwise reason makes no sense)
-   [ ] Humer arguement for why science and reason assume free will
