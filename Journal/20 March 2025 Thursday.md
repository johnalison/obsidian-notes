# The ONE thing: 
- [x] VARs

---
# To Do

- [>>] Make 2D ratio plots (3 figures on the canvas !)
- [>>] ROC plots for various signal points
- [x] VARs
- [x] Modules Summary 
- [>>] More Estimate to Complete
- [>>] Watch SoS approval
- [x] Mail re:Background Synthetic datasets
- [x] Review MAC Meeting slides

M & T to school 

# [[CAM Variance March 2025]]
- pinged Jeff to get the current "burn rate" of the salaries
	- [[CMU HGC Current Burn Rate]]
- pinged MP re:Current Cost variance 80k charged by UCSB
- Submitted two VARs
- Investigating a 80k charge at UCSB... pinged Lipika


# Taught
- Frank-Hertz 
- Mosley X-rays

# [[Stats Data-Driven SR]]
- Discussion using gamma vs gamma/gamma tilde
- Will start looking into the other signals next

More CAM variances

Mail to Ryan Simeon and Sridhara Dasu re: background modeling with synthetic datasets.


# Working Roc Plots
- got one curve at a time.
- Got multiple curves going
- Need to plot from different files
- `python plots/makeRocPlot.py hists/histAll_20250304_a100c66.coffea hists/histAll_signals_cHHHX_20250304_a100c66.coffea --outputFolder roc_curves`
- [>>] Run to make phh plots (SR and HH region)
- [x] Curves for different k-lambdas
- Found spikes in kl = 2.45 sample

# Chat [[Tony Boyle]]
- Needs to reorgaize code to do event loop and other jet loop


More Rocs ... See above

# Chat AE
- [x] Mail Evan
- Discussed updating plotting code
- Boosted skims are done 
- [x] Ping Chance re:access


# Office Hours
- No body

# Rachel 
- Will talk to Rebecca in Stats about 0.25 position + no startup

Finished the VAR. 

Writting up the Modules Meeting [[MAC meeting 19 March 2025]]

# Got the Frank-Hertz Experiment Going!

Home 

Finished [[MAC meeting 19 March 2025]] slides

# Did [[Modules Summary March 2025]]

More ROC plots... 

Some [[Fly By Night Physics]]
