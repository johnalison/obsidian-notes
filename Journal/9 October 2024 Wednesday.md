	- [ ] count events processed before lumi sections
	- [ ] check duplicate events
	- [[Coffea post re lumi counting]]

	- [ ] check given commit. 


# Stats chat
- Long discussion re:training scheuduels (not so useful
- Discussion of unfolding:  
	- Claim (MK) only need a foward model trained on simulation/ this would then be insensitvie to simulation mismodelling
	- [ ] think about this with 1d cartoon

Sent coffea question. 

did mail.

# Hoops
