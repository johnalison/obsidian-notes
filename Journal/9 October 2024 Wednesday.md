# The ONE thing: 
- [ ] 4b Run3 skims


# To Do
- [ ] new skims
- [ ] Watch Pre-Approval VqqHbb
- [ ] CAM Training
- [ ] Read HGC TDR
- [ ] Remake plotting to be more flexible re:hist structure ? 
- [ ]  CAP/LTS online questionnaire and tasks

# Log

Up at 6:45 

H & M & T to school 

# Mails

[[Low mass di-electrons]]

# Chat AE
- [ ] Need way to debug datasets in coffee
	- [x] count lumi sections processed
		- [ ] script to check against JSON
	- [xx] ~~count events processed before lumi sections
		- Already doing
	- [xx] ~~check duplicate events
		- Spot check SRs
	- [[Coffea post re lumi counting]]
- [ ] Debug why the limits changed
	- [x] Run limits weekly 
	- [XX] ~~sparse reAna job to just get to limits (no mixed data ect. systematics)
	- [AE] script to check given commit. 


# Stats chat
- Long discussion re:training schedules (not so useful
- Discussion of unfolding:  
	- Claim (MK) only need a foward model trained on simulation/ this would then be insensitvie to simulation mismodelling
	- [ ] think about this with 1d cartoon

Sent coffea question. 

Did mail.

# Hoops 
- Good runs 4s

# Mortgage call
- 300k down
- 5.99 -> 6.5
- Need to pay $1k upfront

# 4b code base
- added processed lumi section
- updating skip colections and (removing HLT branches)
