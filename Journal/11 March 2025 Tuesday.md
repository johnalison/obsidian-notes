# Long Chat w/Bing

Chat with Herwig re:LDMX 
- Think I finally understand it

# Virtual Update from [[Wesley Terrill]]
- SOS: We are pushing to freeze the documentation for approval but with only Higgsino and one of the TChiWZ scenarios (mN2*mN1<0). I found an empty background bin for the other TChiWZ scenario and the limits are being rerun with the negative scenario binning. The documentation has all been updated and a message sent to the conveners and ARC.  
  
- HGCAL: I am waiting on comments from people on the paper draft. We finally heard back about the cooling unit and it doesn't seem likely that it will be repaired before I leave. Otherwise, I created directions and tried them out on someone else for the measurement system so new measurements can be taken after I am gone.  
  
- Fermilab: I have a draft of the research seminar slides (missing a few plots that I was waiting on for results and interpretations as they are rapidly being updated). I am still working on the outreach talk (10min "outreach talk should not mimic a talk you would give in a public outreach event; instead, it is an opportunity for you to describe your outreach experiences, your outreach philosophy, and your ideas on how you might perform outreach as a Lederman Fellow." ).

- Defense: I would like to send out a poll for a date in April.
