# Feedback on talk:
  Here are my notes on questions people asked for your talk, in case this is useful:

  

milestones, production start, light on schedule, something at the beginning to talk about schedule start when, what rate and when we are done.

use P6, how many days off the CP - subproject CP plot

lack of schedule slides

hiring for less than estimated

  

Was the ESD in the risk register, could say how many risks in risk register, since CD3 how many new or retired

some risks could have less details - use higher level instead

  

In summary, say what they should take away from the talk

  

slide 19: why green is so low in TTU; time scale do not match and numbers do not match to get the total

  

When are you done, no KPP defined for this area only

  

doing time and motion studies

  

anything about rework? from CAF

  

Best regards,

Harry.
