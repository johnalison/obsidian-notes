# The ONE thing: 
- [ ] Validate Subsampling


# To Do
[>] CAM Training
[>] Read HGC TDR
[>] Update printCutFlow to compare cutflows
[>] Fine Tune histogram ranges
- [ ] ~~Script to verify synthetic datasets saw all the input data?~~
[>] Var due!!


# Log

Poor sleep.   Up at 8

M&T to school 
# Fast Day 3
# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- Analyzing seed 0... looks good. not sure If im seeing as much variation as I would expect. 
	- Q: how to test?
- Getting the PSData running
- Will move isMixed / isDataForMixed / ect to more granular flags and config via yaml files
- Step one: Granular flags ... Synthetic data OK / PS Data OK /
