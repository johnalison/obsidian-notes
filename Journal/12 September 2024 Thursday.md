# The ONE thing: 
- [ ] Validate Subsampling


# To Do
- [ ] CAM Training
- [ ] Read HGC TDR
- [ ] Update printCutFlow to compare cutflows
- [ ] Fine Tune histogram ranges

# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- Analyzing seed 0... looks good. not sure If im seeing as much variation as I would expect. 
	- Q: how to test?
- Getting the PSData running
- Will move isMixed / isDataForMixed / ect to more granular flags and config via yaml files
- Step one: Granular flags
