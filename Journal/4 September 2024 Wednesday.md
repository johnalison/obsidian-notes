M&T to school (Chatted with parent in ECE)

# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- cleaning up code 
- Clean dumpTestVectors functions
- Now propagating the btagging scores !! (need to validate)
- Testing on **cmslpc307** ... crashes with Â **RuntimeError: FIXME: handle UnionArray with more than** **127** **contents**
	- Might have to use strings instead of tuples...
- Have test script that reproduces the problem...sent mail to CL/AE

# Gave jetDeClustering talk
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1451193/#b-579849-higgs-to-bb
