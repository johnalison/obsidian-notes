# Log

Up at 7

No ECS... No Cyert... Still have to teach

Walk to campus

# Taught
- [[Idea of the ether comes goes comes]]
- Mass intrinsic and have Ether -> kill ether -> most mass is a emergent property -> how to explain residual mass -> ether 
- Chat with Chance re:research

# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- Added rhoA and B vs pt
-  re-Making the pdfs on **cmslpc345** 
- Job ran out of memory... rerunning after killing stalled jobs and removing detailed histograms
- Reordered daily logs


Idea for [[Hbb Reclustering Project]]
- Run clustering on signal and look for 1b1j splittings. 

Idea for [[UndergradProjects]]
- S-factors Maybe too easy...

# Multihiggs Meeting
- [ ] Think about ttbar mismodelling


# HGC Workshop
- [ ] Look at HGCAL slides:
