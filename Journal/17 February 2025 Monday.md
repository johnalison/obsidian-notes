No ECS... No Cyert... Still have to teach

Walk to campus

# Taught
- [[Idea of the ether comes goes comes]]
- Mass intrinsic and have Ether -> kill ether -> most mass is a emergent property -> how to explain residual mass -> ether 
- Chat with Chance re:research

# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- Added rhoA and B vs pt
-  re-Making the pdfs on **cmslpc345** 


Idea for [[Hbb Reclustering Project]]
- Run clustering on signal and look for 1b1j splittings.
