# Wes Job Talk
- Clean up the format: remove the red borders (Read:https://cmu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CMU_INST/1feg4j8/alma991010814439704436 ) 
- Add intro slide with outline and brief bio: when you joined CMS what you worked on and when you moved to CERN ect. 
- s1: Would add slide about the SM and how it has been so successful
- s2: Then can introduce DM as a big missing piece
	- The figure on left is more Dark Energy than DM. I would put another experimental evidence plot
- s3: Reccomend a thoeory slide on WiMPs instead of DM directly
	- (BTW: what are teh non-collider constraints on Higgsino and Wino-Bino models?)
- s6 Title: Searching for Dark Matter at teh LHC
- s7 Should check if there is a more recent version of this analysis
- s8; Should know what the blob on teh left is.  (How was this sercher for before LHC?)
- s9: Too much text.  Show in pictures examples of multiplets (know what sets M and Î”M)
- s11 too much text. 
- s18 too much text. Show Z* decaying to leptons.  Trick! -> Hard!
- s19 too much text. You should say this.. not write it 
- s20: again you dont need the text. Give example of cuts to define Fake-enriched region
		(better slide spacing/layout)
- s21(better slide spacing/layout) (Maybe combine 20-21)
- s22: why MC so far off ?
- I would but 25 and 26 in backup
- s27: make a version of this that shows
	- the lep limit, old SOS + disappearing tracks, then 
	- the lep limite, new SOS + disappearing tracks, then
	- the lep limit, new SOS + dis. tracks + isolated soft track. 
	- explain the analyses in picture: eg s89 -95 here: https://cms-mgt-conferences.web.cern.ch/conferences/pres_display.aspx?cid=3612&pid=27647 
- kill s28
- s31;  Add slides
	- Discuss MAC produciton at CMU.  
	- Then describe the Silicon lab at CERN 
	- Then explain you went to cern and worked in SI lab. and outline what you did there.
	- Then go on to 32
