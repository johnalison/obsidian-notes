- [ ] Read [[Run2 X->HY->4b]]
- [ ]  Work [[Run2 HH4b AN]]
	 - [ ] Mixed data summary plots
- [ ] BCR
	- [ ] Read BOE
- [ ] Code base work
	- [ ] Histograms to cutflow
	- [ ] Bkg stat uncertainty in ratio band ?
	- [ ] Why is canJet Phi 0-pi ?

# [[Run2 HH4b AN]]
- Working the mixed data summary plots
- Running on **cmslpc336**
- `sourceÂ  .ci-workflows/analysis-mixed-all.sh`
- Found bug with multi-jet weights for mixed background ... 
- Fixing CI... after merge with johnda/master
- Fixed CI ... now mixed cutflow fails !! 
- Now to mixed data summary plots
- ` python -i analysis/iPlot.py --comb hists/ANv3/histAll_noFvT.coffea hists/ANv3/histMixedData.coffea  -m analysis/metadata/plotMixedVsDataVs3b.yml`
- `python analysis/makePlotsMixedVsDataVs3b.py --comb hists/ANv3/histAll_noFvT.coffea hists/ANv3/histMixedData.coffea  -m analysis/metadata/plotMixedVsDataVs3b.yml --out hists/ANv3/mixedVsDataVs3b`
- [ ] Function for processing stack dict in `base_class/plots`
- [ ] Debug `data_3b_for_mixed` cutflow

Chat MP: 
- will send me a relevant BOE... [[HGC MAC BoEs]]
- Maybe add Kussela to the DOE grant ?

# Hoops 
- Great games 4/5s 
- Me and Alvin dominating 

More .. [[Run2 HH4b AN]] (see above)


# Osher 
- Course 3 went well.
- Got a gift card.
- People excited about an experimental lecture
- [ ] Ping no lecture next week, thanks for gift card

Hexaboards arrive ! (48)

# Chat CL: 
 - Great progress! 
 - Will report tomorrow

# Sent [[Inquiry for Module CT Scans Lumafield ]]

Raining steph will pick up
