# Chat Steve ...

# Reviewing Steves Talk
-  **Single-Point Adjustment (SPA)**. An SPA is a formal EVMS “reset” that brings Planned, Earned and Actual cost to the same value on the cut-off date so CPI and SPI restart at 1.00.
- **Estimate Uncertainty (EU)** set-aside (contingency) for that labour. For completed work this is zero.
- $176.94 M total BAC and the $14.82M
