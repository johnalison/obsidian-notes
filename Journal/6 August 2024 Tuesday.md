Up at 7

M and T to school

Setup

# [[mixed2.0]]
- Signal all years crashes b/c splitting not in the data
- Hack for missing input splittings (use the last one)
- Re-running HH4b declustering for all years ... fails
	- Seeing splitting `((bj)`  /  `(((jj)j)j)((bj)` / `40`
	- Found Errors, was overflow in "XXXX" replacement (need better fix longterm)

# Alejandro back ! 

Trying to use templates for meetings

[[Chat with Wes 6 August 2024]]

Long chat with Alejandro:
- group rare splitting by multiplicity
- fit templates ? 
- iterative unwinding  nC + nC' ?

# Hoops
good runs: 4s / 5s/ 4s / 3s

More mixed debugging (see above)

No mans meeting
