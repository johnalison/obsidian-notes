# The ONE thing: 
- [ ] ROC Plots

---
# To Do

- [x] Post Homework #7
- [ ] More Estimate to Complete
- [ ] Maybe synthetic data with re-weight dR(close) vs dR(other) mass plane ?
- [ ] Schedule FNAL badging appointment
- [ ] Make sum/SB/SR plots presentation
- [ ] Make 2D ratio plots (3 figures on the canvas !)
- [x] ROC plots for various signal points
- [x] Watch SoS approval

Up at 7 

M & T to school 

setup

# Taught
- Did the Frank-Hertz Demo! Worked great!

[[Spring 2025]]

Chat MP
- Really depressed re:future funding at CMU... 

Posted HW 7 and solution. 

# Working Roc Plots
- [x] Run to make phh plots (SR and HH region)
- Added kl reweighting function
- GOT kl-rw working!!!
- Added new hists (phh and phh_hh)
- Running all signals on **cmslpc322**
- lots of errors... fixing
- Running on condor
	- `source scripts/analysis-testAll-job.sh `
	- some ZZ4b file transfer failed
	- [x] resubmit
- Signal finished
- Finally finished backgrounds too
- p(HH) seems even better than p(S) !!!
- mailed AE
- [x] push code
- [ ] Add to AN

# Installing python3.10
- `brew install python@3.10`

# Upgrading python venv
- `python3.10 -m venv myPyPlotEnv310`
- `source myPyPlotEnv310/bin/activate`
- `pip install --upgrade pip`
- `pip install -r plots/plot_requirements.txt`

 Got my local python version to match the container ! 

More rocs. Got 

# Hoops
- Highmark ... Good wins

Iterating with Joe re: cleanroom budget 

More Roc plots

Did [[Spring 2025]] review

# Happy Hour with Riccardo and Valentina 

Home with M & T

More ROC plots...
