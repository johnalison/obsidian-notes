# The ONE thing: 
- [ ] ROC Plots

---
# To Do

- [x] Post Homework #7
- [ ] More Estimate to Complete
- [ ]  Maybe synthetic data with re-weight dR(close) vs dR(other) mass plane ?
- [ ] Schedule FNAL badging appointment
- [ ] Make sum/SB/SR plots presentation
- [ ] Make 2D ratio plots (3 figures on the canvas !)
- [ ] ROC plots for various signal points
- [ ] Watch SoS approval

# Taught
- Did the Frank-Hertz Demo! Worked great!

[[Spring 2025]]

Chat MP
- Really depressed re:future funding at CMU... 

Posted HW 7 and solution. 

# Working Roc Plots
- [ ] Run to make phh plots (SR and HH region)
- Added kl reweighting function
- CERN login down

# Installing python3.10
- `brew install python@3.10`

# Upgrading python venv
- `python3.10 -m venv myPyPlotEnv310`
- `source myPyPlotEnv310/bin/activate`
- `pip install --upgrade pip`
- `pip install -r plots/plot_requirements.txt`

 Got my local python version to match the container ! 

More rocs.
