M and T to school

Setup

# [[mixed2.0]]
- Signal all years crashes b/c splitting not in the data
- Hack for missing input splittings (use the last one)
- Re-running HH4b declustering for all years ... fails
	- Seeing splitting `((bj)`  /  `(((jj)j)j)((bj)` / `40`
	- Found Errors, was overflow in "XXXX" replacement (need better fix longterm)
- Re-running HH4b declustering for all years ...  now memory leak somewhere! ?
	- ===> No, turns out much slower with 00-05-00
- Updating slides with new declustering


# Alejandro back ! 

Trying to use templates for meetings

[[Chat with Wes 6 August 2024]]

Long chat with Alejandro:
- group rare splitting by multiplicity
- fit templates ? 
- iterative unwinding  nC + nC' ?

# Hoops
good runs: 4s / 5s/ 4s / 3s

More mixed debugging (see above)

No Mans meeting

install pdflatex [[Setup M3 Macbook]]

# Starting to make pdflatex slides 
added them to my lab repro

Seeing signal crash when running all years (out of memory) during the synthetic datasets... 
- Testing 2018 signal on **cmslpc331**


Got M and T

# Drinks / Dinner with Tony
Good times / Over Eden and Parler
