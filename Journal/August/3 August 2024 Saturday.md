# Early morning [[Jet DeClustering]]
- cluster all jets run with 4 workers after
- Added logic to only plot splittings that are part of non-ISR splittings
	- Had 144 splittings types before ---> now 66
- Added details clustering plots
- update **make_jet_splitting_PDFs.py** to only expect basic clustering plots
- new script (**jet_splitting_study.py** ) to process detailed plots
