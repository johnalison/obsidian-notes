# The ONE thing: 
- [ ] Jet declustering


# To Do

- [x] 4b
	 - [x] 4b + Xj
- [> ] write up S/sqrt(B) argument
- [> ] CAM training

# Escajeda (Masons) Here
- More involved than they thought

M and T to School

Setup

EOS down on LPC... joined LPC computing mattermost channel

# [[mixed2.0]]
- Cant run jobs... can do test jobs!
- Try to optimize with [[Numba]]... Not much improvement 
- Added a profiler to the test job... not clear where we can gain
- EOS back!
- Made PDFs for inclusive jet multiplicities: **jet-splitting-PDFs-00-04-00**
- Running all clustering to check detailed plots
- inclusive Declustering test job works !  with old 00-03-00 pdf
- inclusive Declustering w/ 00-04-00 pdfs  ... works fine
- inclusive declustering full 18 sample...  works with 00-04-00 !
- Bug when making inputs for 00-04-00 (random comb jet flavor order) ... remaking
- Declustered data look good !
- Declustered signal looks GOOD !!
- Scaling up clustering to all years running on **cmslpc329**... 84mins
- Making PDFs from all years  00-05-00
- Scaling up declustering to all years running on **cmslpc329**...**88m46.643s**
