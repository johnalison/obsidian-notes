[[Zeeman Effect]]

# [[Jet DeClustering]]
- Starting to look into making synthetic datasets
- Skimmer test job **source .ci-workflows/skimmer-test-job.sh**  failing locally.
- Trying without --dask... works without dask!
- Questions:
	- How to turn off chunking ? Crank up picoSize ? ... fails if picoSize 10x
	- Now 10x pico size works ! only one output file... GOOD
- To Do
	- [x] Turn off unneeded branches (eg: ZHSR, SB...)
- Got first dummy draft working... now fails when declustering
- Testing on **cmslpc306**


FBC2:
- Not much: Jaco and Lukas away
