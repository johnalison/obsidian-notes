[[Jet DeClustering]]

Lots of debugging!  
- simplified ISR definition (anything splitting that doesnt have bs on both sides is ISR)
- debugging particle order
- Adding nice unit test to verify (FINDING BUGS!!!!)

[[CMU HGC Mac Meeting 1 August 2024]]

[[CMUbbWW 1 August 2024]]

# Gym/Steam Room
- core / farmers carry 80s / cling / step-ups
- 10min at Tmax = 124

More [[Jet DeClustering]]
- fix children_jet_flavors to deal with (XX)Y combinations
- Added unittest

SURA Meeting with Tony
- Useless 
- Met ___ ___


More bug fixes
- Cleaning the parentheses form the children jet flavors
- Now need recursive clean_ISR
	`['bb', '(bb)(jj)'] -> with ISR cleaning ['bb', 'bb', 'jj']
- clustering test job failing ! 
	- Runs in debug... think im running out of memory !!!
