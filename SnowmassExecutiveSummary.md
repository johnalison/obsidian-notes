- describes electroweak and strong interactions up to energies of a few hundred GeV with great accuracy.

- several fundamental questions unexplained such as the details of the evolution of the early universe, the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe, the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the origin of neutrino masses, the origin of the electroweak scale, and the origin of flavor dynamics.

- The EF supports a fast start for the construction of an e+e Higgs Factory (linear or circular), and a significant R&D program for multi-TeV colliders (hadron and muon).

- Finally, the U.S. EF community has expressed renewed interest and ambition to develop options for an energy-frontier collider that could be sited in the U.S., while maintaining its international collaborative partnerships and obligations with, for example, CERN.

- Finally, new machine-learning approaches are fundamentally changing the way we work.

- General Principles:

  - Continue with the science identified in the previous Snowmass/P5

  - The completion of existing experiments and the construction and operation of approved projects, including those prioritized by the 2014 P5 such as the HL-LHC, LBNF/DUNE,

  - As existing approved construction projects come to a completion, a broad and complementary set of new projects should be considered a high priority to maintain the continuity of our investigations and opportunities for new discoveries.

  - Both R&D directed to specific future projects and generic research should be supported in these critical enabling technologies, as well as in new areas such as quantum science and machine learning.

  - cohesive and strategic approach to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in high-energy physics

  - The HEP community must engage with: academia, kindergarten-postdoctoral training, private industry, government policymakers, and the broader society.
    A structure for formulating a coordinated approach to achieve these goals should be created and provided with the resources needed for success.
