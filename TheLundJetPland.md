# The Lund Jet Plane (Dreyer Gavin Salam Soyeze)

https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04758


- In a Lund diagram the available phase-space is mapped to a triangle in a two dimensional (logarithmic) plane that shows the transverse momentum and the angle of any given emission with respect to its emitter.
  Each given emission creates new phase space (a triangular leaf) for further emissions.
