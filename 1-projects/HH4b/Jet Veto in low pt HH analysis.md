In the low pt analysis we will veto events that would be in the nominal 4b region. This is straightforward for four-tag events; if there are four or more high-pt tagged jets, veto the event.

An interesting question is how to do this for three-tag events. What fraction of the three-tag events should be vetoed because they are likely to extrapolate into the nominal four-tag region? We can estimate this using the nominal JCM. The JCM allows us to model the b-tagged distribution from the three tag events. We can emulate the four-tag veto by vetoing three-tag events that have four or more pseudo-tag jets. Â An even better way is to just weight the three-tag events by the probability that they give fewer than four for high-pt pseudo-tagged jets.
