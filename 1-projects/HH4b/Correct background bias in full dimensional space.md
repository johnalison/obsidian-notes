We now assume 4bSB / 3bSB == 4bSR / 3bSR. 

If we measure and correct bias with the synthetic data. we would then only assume a double ratio holds: 
rSR / rSB (data) == rSR / rSB (synthetic data)

# How to measure and correct the bias
- Measure ration of 1D (SvB) projection  vs 
- Measure bias in full phase space with a Bkg vs Synthetic Data classifier (like FvT)

Bkg = w_SvD x w_FvT x w_JCM
