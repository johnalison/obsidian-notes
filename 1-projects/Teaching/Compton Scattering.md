Experimental verification that photons scatter off of electrons like particles.

BIG DEAL!

A photons (which has a particular wavelength) hits an electron, come out with a differnet (longer) wavelength. 
- Cannot happen in classical E&M !
- Everything in classical E&M happens at some frequency

Convinced the community that photons really exist. 
	eg: quantized massless photons with E & p

This experiment has 3 key results
- photons exist
- Can measure me
- Test prediction of Classical EM vs QFT

**Experiment**: 
- Cs(137) source in lead housing
- gamma emitter at 0.6 MeV
- Channeled into a beam, hits electrons
- Detector: NaI crystal, emits small, brief flash of light when a gamma goes into it
	- Size of flash ~ Egamma
- Stage is movable. Make measurements at various Î¸
- Light detected with PMT -> DAQ - > computer
