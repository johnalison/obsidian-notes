# Problem Ideas
(Should also ask chatGPT)

### Relativity Kinemaitcs
Muons at sea level.
   How many muons survive at sea level assuming no time dialation with time dialation
   In MPL we have an experiment which stops the muon as measures thier lifetime to be 2.1 µs. 
   What fraction of the muons reach the ground ? 

### Relativity Dynamics
- Muon collider:  Given Muon beam energy...  Fraction of c moving / Lifetime in lab frame / Angle of electron Lab from given angles in rest frame ? 

- Muons at sea level.
   How many muons survive at sea level assuming no time dialation with time dialation
