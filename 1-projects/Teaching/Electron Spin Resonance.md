Condensed Matter Physics 

Investigate interactions of electron spin: 
- external magnetic field 
- chemical environment 
- nucleus 
- among themselves (eg: How far apart do atoms need to be before spins do not interact?) 

Setup: 
- Source of energy: Microwave clystron:  10 GHz 
- When E interaction matches the energy of microwave photons, can system can absorb microwaves
- Measure signal reflected 
- Scan over field strength
- Instrumentation to control the magnet 
- Gaus meter to measue B-field
- Scope and Computer to do DAQ
