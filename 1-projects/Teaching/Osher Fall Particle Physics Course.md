# Welcome Mail

Hello,   
  
  My name is John Alison and I will be the instructor for the Particle Physics Course.
Reminder that the course will be held weekly on Wednesdays from 2:30 - 4:00 PM in Osher Room A, starting on November 6h. There will be four sessions, with no class on the day before Thanksgiving.

Here is my plan for four weeks. 

Week 1: Big Picture: Newton’s dream & 20th Century Revolution

Week 2: Mission Barely Possible: Quantum Mechanics + Relativity

Week 3: The Higgs Boson

Week 4: Problems with Particle Physics: Going beyond the Higgs

There will be no homework is there is no required reading/work before hand.

Looking forward to getting started! 
john
