Raman is one of the Atomic and Molecular experiments

Inelastic scattering of polarized laser light to discern the modes of vibration of a molecule.
 
GOAL: Test which of several possible force modesl agrees best with the data
 
Data: Illuminate liquid sample of various materials with polarized laser light. Light scatters from the molecules. (Benzeene / C-Cl4) and the scattering is inelastic. Some initial light energy is lost to the vibration of the molecule, internal energy of the molecule. Detector measure the scattered light, the amount of energy left over.

Polarization tells you about which mode of vibration you have excited.
Polarization is preserved by symmetric modes of vibration.  Non-symmetric modes change the polarization. 

So you will measure the intensity of scattered light, energy and polarization state, you get info about which modes were excited

Task to test 3 force models
- Valence force model ( CL - C interactions)
- Extended to include electrons in bonds
- Also CL with one another

(Non of the modesl are correct. Not Quantum)

DAQ very simple. Automated. Most computationally oriented.
