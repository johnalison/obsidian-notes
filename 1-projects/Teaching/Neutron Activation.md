Atomic spectroscopy incredibly useful! 
- fingerprint atom / uncover internal dynamics / ect 

This experiment is about doing the same thing for the nucleus. 
Big problem r_Nuc ~ 1e-5 r_atom   => E_n  ~ 1e5 E_atom. 

Atoms activate with light 
	=> here need nuclear reactor
Atoms measure spectra with diffraction grating 
	=> here need specialized equipment to see X-rays/gamma rays

Ordinary matter activated by neutrons: 
Excited states decay n → p + (stuff)

Take non-radioactive material and expose it to neutrons. 

Place activated material in detectors:
- measure energy of γs 
- Count how many decays / s

~100 elements to play this game with
Once you learn the technique we wil give you material that is activated, and you tell us what the material is.

Experimental setup: PMT -> wave forms -> Amplified -> Digitized and analyzed with a computer
