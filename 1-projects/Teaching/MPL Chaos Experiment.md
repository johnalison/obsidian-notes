Classical Mechanics experiments, but of a sort you have probably never encountered. 

20th we thought we new everything about Classical Mechanics... this was true until the advent of nonlinear dynamics and chaos

Relevent to most of the world

Approximation of a Duffing oscillator

Simple pendulum, single equilibrium position  (a simple attractor)
Our case, unstable equilibrium two pair of magnets 

frequency either periodic motion or chaos

Will bounce back and forth between two magnets in a way that is not random nor predictible.
