One of our condensed matter physics experiments

Goal: Determine the lattice constant and the crystal symmetry of several different solid state materials all of which have some type of cubic symmetry. 

Simplest: "simple cube" atoms in the eight corners of a cube.
Other more complicated possibilities: 
- "Body center" 8 + 1 atoms (one more in the center)
- "Face centered" 8 + 6 (one more in the center of each face)

With x-ray diffraction can determine the separation between planes ("lattice constant") as well as the specific type of crystal symmetry

Intersting thing happens when you have a non-monatomic lattice
- eg: salt NaCl CsCl when the ions alternate in an interesting way

Take a powdered sample
- Detector, 
- Count the number of scattered x-rays as a function of angle
- Brag law (which you will learn about during this experiment)

Requires some specific radiation safety training
