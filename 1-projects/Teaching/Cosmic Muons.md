Cosmic rays from outer space turn into muons in the upper atmosphere.

Pass through 12''^3 block of fancy plastic 
- Emit brief (~ns) flash of light
- Viewed on both sides by photomultipliers

Some Actually stop
- µ→eνν the es also emit a flash of light

If we can measure the Δt between flashes can meausre how long the stopped muons last. 

<u>Equipment</u> 
- PMT need high voltage 2k V
- "fast electronics" to process & digitize signals
- TDC -> digital time -> histogram on computer
(Oscilliscope as debugger)

Lifetime of the muon is a big deal. Its how we measure the strength of the weak force!
Existence of µs at sea level proof relativity is correct.
