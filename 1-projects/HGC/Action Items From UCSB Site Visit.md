# Process

## General
- Remove all Cardboard !
- Separate inspecting and tape removal stations
- re:organize/think through work flow
- OGP stage: warped
- less PSI on modules when blowing dry air

## Gantry:
- Less iso when cleaning baseplate tray
- Remove nubs on pickup tool standoffs
- Si PU tool reflected ? .. No should should change "ch1" label
- Separate mixing station for epoxy: butcher paper with roll 
- Reposition gantry computer

## Bonding:
- Bonding Program to ground wires
- Bond pictures on mini-gantry: camera + pi

## Encapsulation
- Measure encapsulating by weight 
- Counter weight in oscillator
- Weight the encapulant and expoxy, benchmark against standard PSI/time
- Use popscicle stick for encapsulant  vs syringe
- Test encapsulation with higher PSI shorter time


# Purchases
- Another deonizer unt (Reccomend: Digikey desktop unit internal fan)
- Better oven+ temp probe (McMaster suggestion ???)
- Mount vacuum on Uni-strut from the ceiling
- Good Label maker
- Pull tester fixture
- Copper plate for cooling
- Microscope with another axis.
- Clamps on carrying trays
- Sticky pads for wires (?)
- Baker shelving for tooling
- Hexaboard backlighting (?)
