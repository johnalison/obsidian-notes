- 8796 full-sized modules required for CE-H
	- 924 HD will be assembled at UCSB
	- 7872: => 3936 for detector + 5% spares + 120 losses = 4240 each site
- Production plan: 
	- pre-production: 360 w/ 240 working modules ~5% total
	- assuming a pre-production labor inefficiency of 50% (longer duration to build modules)
- Production plan:
	-  Batches of 8%: each 30 days with 27 days of effort = 324 module / month
	- Total of 11 8% blocks+ (3%  and 2% blocks on the ends)

There you find the BoE we wrote for CD2/3 plus backup documentation such as for cleanroom consumables etc
