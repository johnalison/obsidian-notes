  

 **General**: Given report of ATLAS silicon modules cracking, have studied baseplate material to minimize Si stresses. Titanium promising in terms of Si stresses and forces. Expect minimal impact on assembly, tooling , and mounting. An order of titanium plates has been placed.  
  
UCSB: Built more than 5 HD modules and have exercised producing two at a time.  
  
UCSB: Built new HD module with Alumina Baseplate. Observed and studying some noisy channels.  
  
TTU built 4 additional modules with good dimensional and electrical performance characteristics  
(CF baseplates with hybrid gluing)  
  
TTU is progressing on the tooling order for all US MACs. They have collected quotes to establish the cost estimate.  
  
TTU Attempted to hire a technician but was unsuccessful.  
  
TTU plans to build 4 neutron-radiated modules in the coming weeks.  
  
CMU  placed an order for 300 foam inserts for the US MACs for module shipping. 200 for LD-Full and 100 for HD-Full. Will be sufficient for the remainder of pre-series and the ramp-up  
  
CMU Currently assembling two modules at a time.  (CF baseplate and hybrid gluing)  
  
CMU Working towards a singular LabView codebase across all MACs. Assisting other MACs local database used during assembly.
