- [ ] X -> hh ->4b dedicated
- [ ] X->YH -> 4b dedicated 2d scan
- [ ] Semi-supervised


# X → HH → 4b
- [x] Separate HH SR from ZZ and ZH
- [ ] Check modeling in SB (ZZ)
- [ ] Check modeling in mixed data SR after SvB Cut
- [ ] Check bias of SvB cut
- [ ] Refit SvB with decorrelation in mHH
	- [ ] Will want to keep ZZ/ZH/HH signals too 
- [ ] Systematics from mixed data
- [x] Whence the double peaks in mHH ? 

- Near term plan:
	- Extend mass rage to 200 - 1200 GeV  
	- Separate closure tests in mixed data ZZ ZH and HH regions  
	- Do fit background only in unblinded ZZ SR  
	- Present background modeling in B2G
- Longer-term / In parallel :
	- Get signal samples picos
	- Do blinded signal + bkg fit in HH SR
	- Get limits vs mass
	- Plot SvB in HH SR
	- Determine if can gain with a SvB cut
	- Present in B2G (Determine publication plan)


# X → YH → 4b
- 2D Brute force scan
- Solve jet-pairing combinatorics 
- How to unbias FvT in scan 
	- Clever way without brute force refit ? (right to be forgotten)



# Semi-supervised

- Seeing Bias in 2d mass plane after plotting upper tail. 
- Plot lower tail.
- How important is it to cluster in the mass mass plane after a DvB cut ?
