- [ ] X -> hh ->4b dedicated
- [ ] X->YH -> 4b dedicated 2d scan
- [ ] Semi-supervised


# X → HH → 4b
- Separate HH SR from ZZ and ZH
- Check modeling in SB (ZZ)
- Check modeling in mixed data SR after SvB Cut
- Check bias of SvB cut
- Refit SvB with decorrelation in mHH
- Systematics

# X → YH → 4b
- 2D Brute force scan
- Solve jet-pairing combinatorics 
- How to unbias FvT in scan 
	- Clever way without brute force refit ? (right to be forgotten)



# Semi-supervised

- Seeing Bias in 2d mass plane after plotting upper tail. 
- Plot lower tail.
- How important is it to cluster in the mass mass plane after a DvB cut ?
