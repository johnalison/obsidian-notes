Idea here is to not use the ISR splitting when making the templates. 

eg: only use `bj` splittings for combination like: `b(bj)

# Implementation:
 - run clean ISR on clustered jets
 - filter clustered jets for combined jets
 - find matching splitting 


## Follow-ups

- Should probably compare cleaned templates to all templates, if similar gain stats from using ISR
- Would also want to do the same in the reclustering !
