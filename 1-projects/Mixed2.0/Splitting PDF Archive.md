- 00-05-00:  All years and all jet multiplicities (old notCanJet_sel def)
- 00-05-01:  bug fix combined jet flavor definition 
- 00-06-00: 18 with fix all jet mutliplicites (updated nonCanJet def )
- 00-06-01: 18 new groupings (not cleaning ISR)
- 00-06-02: All years / new groupings 
- 00-07-00: All years / Xb/Yj groupings (21 total)
- 00-07-01:       ''        Tuning ranges
- 00-07-02:    like 00-07-01, but with ttbar subtraction
- 00-07-03:    like 00-07-02, but split by year
- 00-08-00:    like 00-07-02, with **JEC/JER** on data. Includes run3 data... wrong btagging/calibration in run2
- 00-08-01:     like 00-08-00 but run3 with right btagging bRegCorr still unclear...
- 00-08-02.     like 00-08-01 but with lower pt selected jets (30 GeV) for Run3
- 00-08-03:     like 00-08-02 but with new Run3 jet calibration
- 00-09-00:     but with rhoA and rhoB pdfs to update the declustered jet masses
- 00-09-01:     like 00-09-00 but with fixed Run3 calibration
