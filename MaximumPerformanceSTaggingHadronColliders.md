- Cherenkov detectors were used to identify s-jets, exploiting their identification power for charged kaons.

- strange-hadrons, such as kaons and lambda baryons, do not only appear in the fragmentation of s-quarks but also are frequently part of d- and u-jets.
   identification of these strange-hadrons is experimentally challenging:

- K+/- and k_L are long-lived.
  K+/- can in principle, be distinguished from other charged particles with the use of Cherenkov detectors or dE/dx
       (Neither viable at the LHC)

- The s-tagging performance for a tagger based on tracking information was found to be similar for d- and u-jets [44], so that we limit ourselves in this study to ùëë-jets as the only background class.
  (Really, no infor in jet charge?)

- the leading particle tends to be a strange-hadron (mostly kaons), while for d-jets, the leading particle is more likely to be a light hadron ‚Äî in particular a pion
